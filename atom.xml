Now you might be interested to know how all this can happen without the “Record Audio” button on YouTube. Don’t worry!

If you are a YouTube Partner, that means you are earning revenue from the ads being shown before and during your videos.</p><p>Before you dive into the below guide, you may need a video editor to start your monetizing on Youtube. Filmora video editor will be the best choice.</p><p>Becoming a skilled video editor takes years of practice, but with Wondershare Filmora video editor, you can produce YouTube videos that have a professional look and feel, even if you are new to the world of video editing. This YouTube Video Creator has big icons and an intuitive interface, so those YouTubers who edit videos for the first time can quickly make a video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-split-button.jpg"                      alt="legend"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Qualifying-for-the-YouTube-Partner-Program"><a href="#Qualifying-for-the-YouTube-Partner-Program" class="headerlink" title="Qualifying for the YouTube Partner Program"></a><strong>Qualifying for the YouTube Partner Program</strong></h2><p>In order to qualify for YPP, you need to prove that you’re creating consistent, original, content and that people are watching your content. YouTube believes that has been proven when you reach these qualifications:</p><ol><li>1000 Subscribers</li><li>4000 Hours of Watch Time (over the past 12 months)</li></ol><p>Not quite there yet?

YouTube may review your content and demonetize you if you seem to have stopped posting videos, but this will not be automatic.</p><p>Remember: meeting these milestones does not grant you automatic monetization.</p><p>You can apply for YPP when you reach the milestones above, but your channel will still need to be reviewed by a human working for YouTube. Reviewers will be watching for:</p><ol><li>Nudity or sexual content</li><li>Harmful, dangerous, threatening, or hateful content</li><li>Violent or graphic content</li><li>Harassment or cyberbullying</li><li>Spam, scams, and misleading metadata</li><li>Copyright infringement or impersonation</li><li>Privacy violations</li><li>Fake subscribers</li><li>Other guidelines violations</li></ol><p>If your content violates any of YouTube’s Community Guidelines you may be denied monetization.

Click where it says <strong>‘active AdSense account’</strong>.</li><li>On the following ‘Monetization’ screen, click <strong>Next</strong> to go to AdSense.</li><li>You will be asked whether you want to use the Google account you’re already signed in to for AdSense, or if you want to use a different account.</li><li>The next step is ‘Your Website’. This will automatically be filled in with your channel. Click <strong>Accept association</strong> if it’s right.</li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> you can only have one AdSense account. Do not make a second one if you already have one.

Companies don’t want to run ads alongside content that doesn’t match the values of their brands.</p><p>YouTube may disable ads on any video it doesn’t think is ad-friendly. Videos which may be flagged as inappropriate for ads include (but are not limited to):</p><ol><li>Videos that cover controversial or sensitive subjects.</li><li>Videos depicting the use of drugs or dangerous products.</li><li>Videos may encourage harmful or dangerous behavior.</li><li>Videos with swearing (but not ALL videos with swearing – quantity and context are factors).</li><li>Videos which contain hate speech.</li><li>Videos that depict family entertainment characters (i.e. Disney princesses) engaged in inappropriate behavior (even if you’re being satirical).</li></ol><p>If you want to make sure all of your content is advertiser-friendly, here are some best practices suggested by YouTube:</p><ol><li>Be respectful of your viewers and any people or groups you may include or mention in your video.</li><li>Extend this respectful tone to your thumbnails and video titles, and make sure your thumbnails and metadata accurately depict your video’s content.</li><li>Don’t try to monetize videos that already contain ads (i.e. <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/154235" >paid product placement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</li></ol><h2 id="How-to-Get-Paid-Through-AdSense"><a href="#How-to-Get-Paid-Through-AdSense" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Paid Through AdSense"></a><strong>How to Get Paid Through AdSense</strong></h2><p>In order to receive a payment from AdSense, you need to earn at least $100.</p><p>For example, if you only earn $10 in a month, you will not receive a payment that month. You will not lose that $10 – you will receive it when your total earnings reach or exceed $100.</p><p>You will also need to provide AdSense with tax information and verify your identity and address in order to start being paid.</p><p>The most popular way to get paid through AdSense is via an EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer). To receive your payments this way, you’ll need to link your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><p>Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Log in to <a href="https://www.google.com/AdSense"><strong>AdSense</strong></a>.</li><li>Click <strong>Settings</strong> in the menu on the left, and then select <strong>Payments</strong>.</li><li>On the Payments page, click <strong>Manage payment options</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Add payment method</strong>.</li><li>You’ll be prompted to add your bank account details.</li><li>Make sure the name on your AdSense account matches the name on your bank account (if you’re under 18 and cannot make your own AdSense account, this may mean you’re using your parent or guardian’s bank account).</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136614/26400" target="_top" id="2136614">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136614" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136614/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-YouTube-Videos-Get-the-Highest-Paying-Ads"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Videos-Get-the-Highest-Paying-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Videos Get the Highest Paying Ads?"></a><strong>Which YouTube Videos Get the Highest Paying Ads?</strong></h2><p>Not all ads pay the same, and not all videos will be able to attract the ads that pay the most.</p><p>How much money your video has the potential to earn depends on:</p><ol><li>The size of your channel</li><li>Your niche on YouTube</li><li>The specific topic of the video</li></ol><p>That the size of your channel matters probably isn’t a surprise. The biggest brands want to run their ads beside videos that are getting more views.</p><p>Whether or not your YouTube niche has a high potential for profit will depend on a couple things:</p><ol><li><strong>How many other channels are in your niche?</strong></li></ol><p>The more people there are making similar videos to you, the thinner the available ads are spread.</p><ol><li><strong>How many cheap or expensive products are being advertised in your niche?</strong></li></ol><p>If the products are free or inexpensive (i.e. free online games) then that limits your earning ability. In large niches like gaming, the few higher paying ads will go to the most popular channels and the low-paying ads will be spread amongst everyone else.</p><p>If you have a very specific niche, i.e. luxury cars, then you will have less competition and the ads available will likely be for more expensive products (and thus the ads themselves will be higher paying).</p><p>Even if you are in a large niche, you can still make videos on specific topics designed to attract higher-paying ads and more revenue. Pay attention to the analytics in your Creator Studio to learn which of your videos earn the most. Then, make more videos on similar topics to boost your earnings.</p><p>Another factor that can affect what ads appear alongside your videos is the viewing habits of individual viewers. People are shown ads that YouTube believes are more relevant to their interests.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130528/26400" target="_top" id="2130528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130528/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Useful-Terminology-CPM-CPC-CPV"><a href="#Useful-Terminology-CPM-CPC-CPV" class="headerlink" title="Useful Terminology (CPM, CPC, CPV)"></a><strong>Useful Terminology (CPM, CPC, CPV)</strong></h2><p>A lot of people think your ad revenue is determined by your view count. This isn’t true – it’s determined by ad impressions.</p><p>How much revenue you earn from the ads running around your videos depends on these three things:</p><p><strong>CPC:</strong> ‘cost per click’. Most of the ads on YouTube are CPC, meaning that an ad impression is only recorded when an ad is clicked on.</p><p><strong>CPV:</strong> ‘cost per view’. Skippable pre-roll ads are the only ads on YouTube which record ad impressions without clicks. These ads record ad impressions when viewers watch 30 seconds of the ad instead of skipping it.</p><p><strong>CPM:</strong> ‘cost per mille’ or ‘cost per thousand’. This refers to how much money gets paid out for 1000 ad impressions.</p><p>Your CPM will be affected by a multitude of things including the ads themselves and the size of your channel. AdSense has made it a rule that you cannot disclose your CPM to anyone, which makes it difficult to determine what you should expect.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> never click on ads near your own videos or instruct your viewers&#x2F;friends to do so. If your clicks are higher than what AdSense considers normal they may ban you.</p><p>Sites like <a href="https://socialblade.com/"><strong>Social Blade</strong></a> provide estimated earnings for any channel you want to look up. Looking up channels that are where you plan to be in the near future could help you set your own expectations.</p><p>Are you able to monetize your videos?

However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p><p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p><p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p><p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p><p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="1.

Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram</h4><p>Images and one-minute long videos can engage with your users, help them work up an appetite for your videos, and direct them to your YouTube channel for more.</p><p>The great thing about Instagram — compared to YouTube — is that it’s easier to produce content for Instagram every day without exhausting your resources.</p><p>Be thinking about what you can post on to Instagram while you work on your YouTube video. You want a really attractive image or short video, which can be something you capture as you work on your long-form video: short preview or behind the scenes footage.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-Share-Your-Life"><a href="#2-Share-Your-Life" class="headerlink" title="2.

This allows you to connect with your audience as they discover more about you, so when it comes time for the YouTube video, they feel that have an established relationship with you.</p><p>They see your picture or video on their feed every day after all. You and your followers are practically friends.</p><p>While Instagram has multiple ways you can post onto the platform, we will talk about two very different strategies:</p><h3 id="How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed"><a href="#How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed" class="headerlink" title="How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed"></a>How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed</h3><p>When you post an image or a video onto Instagram directly it will be on your timeline and acts as a tile for your whole Instagram feed page.

The ability to offer something timely and encourage the viewer to swipe up is a fantastic way to catch your audience when they are most interested in your content.

While your audience can still view the video on the Facebook timeline, your fans scrolling by wouldn’t even notice it.</p><p>This is Facebook’s way of encouraging you to post videos directly to Facebook’s platform. Which is something you should consider as well, but as you are currently working to grow your YouTube channel, it’s good to focus on this task first.</p><p>Well, how do you make the post look better? There is a tool called<a class="link"   href="https://thumbtube.com/" >Thumb Tube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that gives you full sized image on Facebook:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-youtube-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Share YouTube on Facebook 2"                ></p><p>Thumb Tube takes your YouTube video link and redirects it so it is now hosted on ThumbTube.com.

Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1.

Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin.

Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p><p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tag-brand-influencer-twitter.jpg"                      alt="Tag brand and influencer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111968/7443" target="_top" id="2111968">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111968" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111968/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p><p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p><p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p><p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss.

Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p><p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p><p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p><h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="1. Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit"></a>1. Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit</h4><p>If you can tap into the community values of Reddit, contribute to conversations and share interesting and relevant content there might not be a better platform to grow your YouTube audience.</p><p>Many media organizations with a significant following are starting to <a class="link"   href="https://medium.com/@davelee/a-journalists-guide-to-reddit-your-newest-super-source-fa250e967b97" >use Reddit to find stories and viral content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The chances of being discovered on Reddit is much higher than on Twitter, as the upvote&#x2F;downvote system gives your good work a higher platform to stand on while lowering the bad content to Reddit’s cellar.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself"><a href="#2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Promote Yourself"></a>2. Don’t Promote Yourself</h4><p>Reddit is not a platform where you enter, drop your content in, and expect people to engage with it. For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p><p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p><h4 id="3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes"><a href="#3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes" class="headerlink" title="3. Understand the Reddiquettes"></a>3. Understand the Reddiquettes</h4><p>When engaging on Reddit, you must abide by rules which are called “reddiquette.” There are global reddiquettes and then there are individual community reddiquette.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette"><strong>Global reddiquettes</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p>- Search for duplicate content before posting.</p><p>- Consume the content before voting.</p><p>- Act as you would in real life.</p><p>- And more.</p><h4 id="3-Community-reddiquettes"><a href="#3-Community-reddiquettes" class="headerlink" title="3. Community reddiquettes"></a>3. Community reddiquettes</h4><p>These are additional rules that the individual Reddit communities enforce. Be sure to read these rules before posting onto these specific communities. Understanding these rules will help you understand the purpose of this community.</p><p>Here is an example of reddiquettes for r&#x2F;Cameras:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reddit-community-guideline-sample.jpg"                      alt="reddit community guideline sample"                ></p><p>You only have so many strikes with Reddit before your account gets banned. But don’t worry about all that. Be your awesome self.</p><p>When you are on Reddit, don’t think of yourself as a YouTuber, think of yourself as a redditor, if you do, you’ll have a bright future on the platform.</p><h4 id="4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely"><a href="#4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely" class="headerlink" title="4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely"></a>4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely</h4><p>While there are some subreddits that demand relevant content, some subreddits will allow you post your videos as long as 90% of your content are from another source aside from your YouTube channel, you won’t be considered spammy.</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YouTuber</strong>: Get critiques for your videos</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;Videos</strong>: Post any video into the masses</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YTPL</strong>: Share a whole playlist</p><p>Because these subreddits are unfocused and loaded with a variety of content, it’s often tricky to find your specific audience there.

Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism"></a>1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism</h4><p>Snapchat is young, fun, and silly. On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p><p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote-account-to-get-views.jpg"                      alt="promote account to get views"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328683">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328683">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328683%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328683/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>YouTuber, Markiplier tweeting his Snapchat username.</em></p><p>Here are a few quick tips for promoting your Snapchat account.</p><p>- Make sure your Snapchat handle is present on your YouTube channel and other social media platforms.</p><p>- Make your<a class="link"   href="https://blackatlascreative.com/blog/how-do-snapchats-snapcodes-work/" >Snapchat snapcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>your profile pic, so people can scan and connect with you.</p><p>- Get other Snapchatters to give you a shout-out on their account.</p><p>Marketing on social media is essential for not only growing your YouTube channel but your entire brand.

Some YouTubers aren’t patient enough to meticulously grow their channels, which is why they opt to buy views and subscribers from providers that promise miracles.</p><p>The question remains whether or not these aforementioned miracles are just a scam designed to take your money. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Buying subscribers carries a certain amount of risks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, because YouTube’s algorithm may recognize fake subscribers and views, and that can result in a red flag on your channel or a ban.

However, low prices for such services are the first sign that something isn’t right because getting hundreds of subscribers for just $5 is unrealistic.</p><p><a href="https://viralyft.com/buy-youtube-subscribers"><strong>Viralyft</strong>:</a> There are many ways to grow your YouTube channel, and buying subscribers is one of the most dangerous ways, since it may result in penalties that will ruin your YouTube channel. Viralyft is offering 500 worldwide subscribers for $49.99, and they provide no information about the delivery method. You should always ask questions about the delivery method before doing business with a service like this.</p><p>One thing they do promise is that the subscribers you can buy from them are safe, but they offer no proof that you will not be caught.</p><p><a href="http://www.view2.be/buy-youtube-subscribers/"><strong>View2be:</strong></a> View2Be offers 500 subscribers for $45. This is a more realistic price than $5, but the delivery time they are promising could be risky. A sudden increase in subscribers within 24 to 72 hours could raise a red flag with YouTube’s algorithm suspicion.</p><p>View2Be does guarantee to give you your money back if they don’t deliver subscribers.</p><p>A better alternative to buying subscribers from View2be might be their view exchange platform, in which you earn real human views on your videos by watching other people’s videos.</p><p><a href="https://zeru.com/buy-youtube-views"><strong>ZERU:</strong></a> A huge number of clients that are advertised as a sort of a guarantee that the ZERU provides reliable services. This is somewhat misleading because it diverts the attention from the truly important information. There is no sign of delivery method explanations (where do the subscribers come from?), only a promise that they will deliver the subscribers within a day or two.</p><p>You want to know where your subscribers are coming from. If you are an American YouTuber, for example, and you suddenly receive a large number of subscribers from Asian countries then that will be suspicious of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><p>YTView’s claim that subscribers you will be buying are 100% real isn’t supported by any other fact featured on their website. ZERU will sell you a hundred subscribers for $20.</p><p><a href="https://www.qqtube.com/"><strong>QQTube</strong>:</a> For only $25 you can get 10,000 subscribers per day, which is one of the cheapest offers on the market. That delivery window could look suspicious to YouTube, but if that’s a risk you’re willing to take then with QQTube at least you won’t be risking a lot of money.</p><p>QQTube’s website doesn’t mention anything about safety, which is worrying, but they do offer geographic targeting which is important.</p><p><a href="http://socialgrand.com/buy-youtube-subscribers/"><strong>SocialGrand:</strong></a> Social Grand offers 500 subscribers for $34,90 or a thousand subscribers for $62,90. They promise to get your YouTube channel a better reputation, which is a huge claim that we would be wary of.</p><p>Their argument that their service is cost-effective and that it will earn you money is not only a cause for concern, but it is dangerous as well because penalties for fake subscribers on AdSense are much harsher than on YouTube.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657400/16446" target="_top" id="1657400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657400/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-3-Ways-to-Get-Free-Subscribers"><a href="#Top-3-Ways-to-Get-Free-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Top 3 Ways to Get Free Subscribers"></a>Top 3 Ways to Get Free Subscribers</h2><p>YouTube’s community and YouTube’s algorithm both favor authenticity, and for that reason, these organic ways to get subscribers will have a much stronger impact on your YouTube channel than any amount of subscribers you can buy.</p><p>Buying subscribers creates the illusion of short-term growth, while these free methods will result in real long-term growth.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Master SEO:</strong></a>If you would like to grow your YouTube channel, then mastering SEO is the right way to go. Use keywords in the titles of your videos, playlists, and your videos’ descriptions.</p><p>Many powerful keyword research tools can help you find the best keywords for your videos. One simple method is to simply search for your topic on Google and YouTube and see what other content creators are using to rank well.</p><p>A good performance in search rankings can only be achieved by strategic thinking and careful planning, so before you upload a video to YouTube do a little research to find the best keywords for your videos.</p><p>You can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube SEO here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Post Consistently: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> You can hardly expect to have a loyal community of subscribers if you post videos every two or three months. Post a lot of videos and post them consistently (i.e. on the same day every week) because, if you do so, viewers will feel the anticipation and be more likely to watch your videos as soon as they are uploaded. Getting a lot of traffic in the first 24 hours of your video being uploaded is great for SEO.</p><p>If you manage to post four videos in a month, the number of subscribers to your account will grow organically, and you won’t need fake subscribers. You’ll get new subscribers for free.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Produce Collab Videos: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> Nobody can make it on their own; we all need the support of the people around us. Collaborating with other YouTubers that share your interest in the topic you are covering can be beneficial in many ways. First, when you collaborate you each introduce the other creator to a lot of new potential subscribers. Second, you begin to build a support network that you can rely on when you run into trouble (your YouTube friends may be able to share useful advice and even resources with you as you both grow).</p><p>Considering the risks, would YOU ever buy YouTube subscribers?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-a-childs-fortune-the-wealthy-world-of-youtubes-youngest-star/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved A Child’s Fortune The Wealthy World of YouTube’s Youngest Star</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/implify-your-youtube-presence-with-flawless-shorts-thumbnails/"><u>[New] Simplify Your YouTube Presence with Flawless Shorts Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/he-charisma-of-jittery-text-2-methods-unleashed/"><u>[New] The Charisma of Jittery Text 2 Methods Unleashed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-creative-power-for-youtube-intros-in-imovie/"><u>[New] Unlocking Creative Power for YouTube Intros in iMovie</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-decrypting-youtube-live-thumbnails-for-success-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Decrypting YouTube Live Thumbnails for Success for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-elite-hd-video-capture-software-listings/"><u>[Updated] Elite HD Video Capture Software Listings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-leveraging-obs-for-smooth-streaming-mac-and-pc-users-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Leveraging OBS for Smooth Streaming Mac & PC Users' Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/1725286690102-blu-ray/"><u>Blu-Rayディスク徹底解明：理解から利用法、変換方法まで網羅したオールインクルーズ記事</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-factory-reset-ipad-or-apple-iphone-xr-without-icloud-password-or-apple-id-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Factory Reset iPad or Apple iPhone XR without iCloud Password or Apple ID?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ing-the-spark-selecting-top-youtube-videos-for-channels-for-2024/"><u>Igniting the Spark Selecting Top YouTube Videos for Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/oneplus-ace-2-not-connecting-to-wi-fi-12-quick-ways-to-fix-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>OnePlus Ace 2 Not Connecting to Wi-Fi? 12 Quick Ways to Fix | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/transformez-votre-fichier-mp4-en-format-m4v-sans-frais-gratuit-avec-movavi/"><u>Transformez Votre Fichier MP4 en Format M4V Sans Frais - Gratuit Avec Movavi</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/k-potential-the-best-hr-vlogs-1-10/"><u>Unlock Potential The Best HR Vlogs #1-10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/king-facebook-integration-sharing-youtube-vids-with-ease-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking Facebook Integration Sharing YouTube Vids with Ease for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It is not the best platform for every video creator, though. This article will introduce you to some YouTube alternatives.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons you might want to learn about other websites like YouTube. You might want a site with less ads, or different ways of monetizing. YouTube can sometimes remove videos unfairly, so you may want a site where copyright claims are handled by people instead of robots. A lot of users simply want a site that is more like YouTube was when it was younger. There are features, like customizable channel pages, which have been discarded over the years.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="YouTube-Alternatives-3-Best-Video-Sharing-Sites-1"><a href="#YouTube-Alternatives-3-Best-Video-Sharing-Sites-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Alternatives: 3 Best Video Sharing Sites"></a>YouTube Alternatives: 3 Best Video Sharing Sites</h2><p>Here is a list of other places where you can upload videos:</p><h4 id="1-Dailymotion"><a href="#1-Dailymotion" class="headerlink" title="1. Dailymotion"></a>1. Dailymotion</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-dailymotion.JPG"                      alt="YouTune Alternatives - Dailymotion"                ></p><p>This may be the second most popular free video sharing website, and it is very similar to YouTube in appearance. Like YouTube, Dailymotion recommends videos to users based on what is trending as well as their personal viewing habits. Also like YouTube, there are ads in and around videos and you have the option of monetizing your content to earn ad revenue. There is more than one way to become a Dailymotion partner, though. You can sell a subscription for your channel instead of monetizing ads in your videos.</p><p>The main difference between Dailymotion and YouTube is that where YouTube has an abundance of both amateur and professional quality video, Dailymotion skews towards professional. There are personal vlogs and cat videos, but these are less the norm on Dailymotion than on YouTube. You may find less competition in your genre here. However, you should be aware that the expectations of viewers might be higher.</p><h4 id="2-Vimeo"><a href="#2-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="2. Vimeo"></a>2. Vimeo</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternative-vimeo.JPG"                      alt="YouTube Alternatives - Vimeo"                ></p><p>Although Vimeo is also a very popular video site, it is very different from YouTube. Everything from appearance to the types of comments left on videos is vastly different. The front page of this site does not display trending videos, for example. Instead it features high quality creative content that has been reviewed and singled out by Vimeo’s staff as some of the best the site has to offer.</p><p>There also are not any ads on Vimeo, whereas YouTube is full of them.</p><p>If you create, or are interested in creating, short films then this is where you should be posting. Many festival quality shorts are posted to Vimeo. There are vlogs there too, but they tend to be by serious video creators. The community on Vimeo tends to be a lot friendlier than YouTube so if you are still an amateur, but have dreams of being a pro, then this is probably still the site for you. You should be able to find real constructive criticism here rather than trolls.</p><p>Vimeo has a wider variety of privacy settings than YouTube. You can make videos watchable by everyone, just certain people, or require a password.</p><h4 id="3-ZippCast"><a href="#3-ZippCast" class="headerlink" title="3. ZippCast"></a>3. ZippCast</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-zippcast.JPG"                      alt="YouTune Alternatives - ZippCast"                ></p><p>ZippCast is praised by some for being very similar to pre-Google YouTube. While the expectations for video quality may be slightly higher on DailyMotion than YouTube, and are much higher on Vimeo, they are basically the same on ZippCast. Comedy, gaming, music, animation, and vlogging are the most popular categories and almost all content is posted by average people with average skill levels. One of the ways in which ZippCast is like the ‘old’ YouTube is that you can customize the design of your channel.</p><p>One of the things users appreciate most about ZippCast is that identifying and removing copyrighted videos is done by humans rather than an automated system, like on YouTube. This means that if you use copyrighted content that is licensed to you or protected by fair use your video should not be taken down. It is common for YouTubers to have their videos unfairly removed, although disputing the copyright claim will usually result in getting the video restored.</p><p>Although it is definitely large enough to be considered an alternative to YouTube, ZippCast has been unreliable in the past (i.e shutting down randomly) and has lost the trust of many users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-tools-for-effortless-recording-of-desktop-screens-on-windows-10/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top Tools for Effortless Recording of Desktop Screens on Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-graphic-portrayal-of-future-social-momentum/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Graphic Portrayal of Future Social Momentum</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-masterful-descriptions-for-youtube-success/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Masterful Descriptions for YouTube Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-boosting-video-management-creating-an-effective-youtube-watch-later-list/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Boosting Video Management Creating an Effective YouTube Watch Later List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-revolutionize-your-followers-list-with-top-twitter-cleanup-tools-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Revolutionize Your Followers List with Top Twitter Cleanup Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/approved-guide-to-securely-copying-youtube-music-tracks-safely/"><u>2024 Approved Guide to Securely Copying YouTube Music Tracks Safely</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-credit-card-on-your-iphone-12-pro-apple-id-and-apple-pay-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Credit Card on Your iPhone 12 Pro Apple ID and Apple Pay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-screen-lock-pin-on-zte-like-a-pro-5-easy-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Remove Screen Lock PIN On ZTE Like A Pro 5 Easy Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-instagram-speed-demos-like-video-duo-for-rapid-growth/"><u>In 2024, Instagram Speed Demos Like-Video Duo for Rapid Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/1722977004851-pet-scans-measure-metabolic-activity-which-is-higher-in-active-tumor-cells-compared-to-non-active-or-necrotic-tissue/"><u>PET Scans Measure Metabolic Activity, Which Is Higher in Active Tumor Cells Compared to Non-Active or Necrotic Tissue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/smooth-and-stable-fps-fluctuations-tackled-in-latest-cyberpunk-2077-update/"><u>Smooth and Stable: FPS Fluctuations Tackled in Latest Cyberpunk 2077 Update</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/be-monetization-changes-500-subscribers-now-eligible-for-2024/"><u>YouTube Monetization Changes 500 Subscribers Now Eligible for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151884/7443" target="_top" id="2151884">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151884" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151884/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Choosing A Potential Partner"></a>1. Choosing A Potential Partner</h2><p>Before you think about how you’re going to approach someone you need to decide who you want to approach.</p><p>A lot of people automatically want to approach their YouTube hero, and that can be a mistake. Liking your partner’s videos is a must – why would you want to refer your subscribers to someone whose channel you wouldn’t watch yourself? – but it can be really hard to get someone with a significantly bigger channel than yours to work with you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-potential-collab-partner.jpg"                      alt=" Choosing A Potential Partner"                ></p><p><em>Will Kitty get to collab with the big dog?</em></p><p>Larger YouTubers get a lot of collab requests, and they are really busy with their own channels. Even if they love your content, it can be hard to justify taking time away from working on their own channel to do videos that won’t help them grow too.</p><p>Collaborating with someone your own size means you both stand to gain equally in channel growth. Instead of approaching someone you love that’s huge, try finding someone you like just as much whose sub count is similar to yours.</p><p>There are exceptions to this, of course. The team at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVPcEbVLQgLZX0Rt6jo34A" >Mr.Kate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> managed to work with YouTubers who had millions of subs while they were still under 1 million. They got these high profile collabs because they had something additional to offer that made up for the subscriber gap – they were redesigning the apartments, offices, or studios of the YouTubers they did the collabs with. If you want to work with someone bigger than you, think about what you might be able to offer them in place of new subscribers.</p><p><em>Mr.Kate makes over **<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoMPWcQKA%5F9Af5YhWdrZgw?sub_confirmation=1" >MyLifeAsEva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**’s bedroom.</em></p><p>Also, try to find someone whose channel has something in common with yours thematically so you know your subscribers will be interested in them. They don’t have to do exactly what you do, but your topics should be related. For example: if you do quirky video game reviews and they do quirky movie reviews, you could team up to review a movie based on a game. That would make sense. But if you quirky video game reviews and they review do very serious ice cream reviews, that’ll make a lot less sense.</p><p>A good way to find potentially collab partners is to look at your list of subscribers. You already know everyone there likes your channel!</p><h2 id="2-How-to-contact-a-partner"><a href="#2-How-to-contact-a-partner" class="headerlink" title="2. How to contact a partner"></a>2. How to contact a partner</h2><p>Sometimes people leave contact info in their video descriptions, but it might be easier to go to the <strong>About</strong> tab on their channel page and check for an email address. Look for a field that says <strong>for business inquiries</strong>, click on <strong>view email address</strong>, and use the CAPTCHA that appears to prove you aren’t a robot.</p><p>Reaching out more casually through Twitter DMs, YouTube comments, or Facebook is good too, but you should use those platforms more to build a relationship that could lead to a collab. If someone had never commented on a video of yours before and then commented once just to ask you to collab it’d be hard to believe they were really interested in your channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/994842/11832" target="_top" id="994842">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-994842" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/994842/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Popular Types of Collab Videos"></a>3. Popular Types of Collab Videos</h2><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7afFvLLvTiWI97M0jaqgKQ"><strong>Gabrielle</strong></a>talks about different types of collabs and how well they work.</em></p><p>In most cases when you do a collab, you’ll each want to have content to post to your own channels (unless you’re doing some type of interview). You don’t want to put a lot of effort into a video that won’t end up being ‘yours’. Here are a few different ways to collaborate:</p><h4 id="1-Shout-outs"><a href="#1-Shout-outs" class="headerlink" title="#1. Shout outs"></a>#1. Shout outs</h4><p>In this type of collab all you do is mention each other and, usually, use YouTube cards to link to each other’s channels. You make a video that is completely yours, and at some point in it you talk about your partner’s channel and why you like it. To make things fair, you should discuss how long the mentions will be and where in the videos they will happen. It wouldn’t feel good to gush about how great someone is for a full minute near the beginning of your video and have them spend two seconds mentioning you near the end of theirs.</p><p>I personally don’t check people out just because someone I like mentions them, so this might not be the best way to go if you’re hoping to bring in new subscribers. It is the easiest kind of collab to do, though.</p><h4 id="2-Guest-spots"><a href="#2-Guest-spots" class="headerlink" title="2. Guest spots"></a>2. Guest spots</h4><p>This is my favorite kind of collab to watch, because each YouTuber has sole creative control over the video that goes on their channel. Instead of trying to blend your styles together, you each make videos that reflect your own personal styles.</p><p>For your video, you have the other vlogger on as a guest. In the video you do the same kinds of things your fans like watching you do, and you include the other person. If they’re alright with it, it can be fun to draw them a bit outside their comfort zone. If you like to dance on your channel, and they never dance on theirs, ask them to dance with you!</p><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VX0KXNH20x9MCH3xGjisg" >Matthias <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> gets <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NateWantsToBattle" >NateWantsToBattle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – who does song parodies on his channel – to make balloon animals.</em></p><p>Turnabout is fair play, of course, so be prepared to step a bit outside of your own comfort zone when you appear as a guest in one of their videos.</p><p>Alternatively, you could just introduce your guest and then let them take over and then do the same thing in reverse on their channel.</p><h4 id="3-Long-distance-collabs"><a href="#3-Long-distance-collabs" class="headerlink" title="3. Long distance collabs"></a>3. Long distance collabs</h4><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-S6eBuL9SlwNZTHI6P9Bg" >Lauren <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is in Toronto and <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiE7g4J3QXBwPUybbRdioQ" >Aja <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is in LA, but that doesn’t mean they can’t cook together! Also: Lauren’s channel is about food and Aja’s is about healthy living – they aren’t exactly the same, but they’re related enough that the collab makes sense.</em></p><p>Sometimes you really want to work together, but geography just won’t bend to your wills. That doesn’t mean you can’t collab. You can always send each other some footage to cut to and make videos together that way. Or, you can do a Google Hangout or Skype chat and record it.</p><h2 id="4-Getting-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Collaborations"><a href="#4-Getting-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Collaborations" class="headerlink" title="4. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations"></a>4. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations</h2><p>Usually, you have two reasons for wanting to do a collab; having fun with another YouTuber, and growing your channel. The collab exposes you to their subscribers, who will hopefully decide they like you and subscribe to you too. There are ways of increasing the odds of this happening.</p><p>Commenting on each other’s videos, and responding to viewer comments, is one of the best. It will help you seem more like a person who is being introduced than a guest star in a video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/getting-most-out-of-collaborations.jpg"                      alt=" Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902289/19272" target="_top" id="1902289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902289/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Kitty got the collab!

Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists"></a><strong>1. Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists</strong></h2><p>YouTube playlists are an excellent way to chain together your video content and organize your channel, which will both translate into more views.</p><p>A quality playlist groups together several videos that are in some way similar. Think about the different ways you could sort your videos – by topic, by type, etc. – and make as many playlists as you can come up with. You can even reuse the same videos on multiple playlists where it makes sense. After you’re done, viewers who want to see all of you Call of Duty Let’s Plays or all of your makeup pallet reviews will be able to find them easily and will spend much more time watching your videos.</p><p>By creating a themed playlist of videos that will play one after another you increase the chances of your viewers sticking around to watch multiple videos. Making playlists helps you direct traffic from your more popular videos to the ones that haven’t gotten as many views, and it also helps drive up your watch time. Watch time is an important metric for YouTube’s search engine. When you increase your watch time, you can rank higher in search results and even get more views on YouTube.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137395/7443" target="_top" id="2137395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137395/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Create-Custom-YouTube-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Create-Custom-YouTube-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2.

Spending a bit of time in Photoshop or a free online program like Canva on custom thumbnails for every video will help to boost YouTube views and earn you more clicks.</p><p>By having specialty thumbnails you will also have another type of content that is indexed by search engines. Every video you post will be searchable by not only text (your description) and video searches, but by image searches as well.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >For a list of YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884017/19272" target="_top" id="1884017">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884017" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884017/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Be-a-Part-of-the-Community"><a href="#3-Be-a-Part-of-the-Community" class="headerlink" title="3. Be a Part of the Community"></a><strong>3. Be a Part of the Community</strong></h2><p>Regularly viewing videos from other channels within your genre, especially channels about the same size as yours, and taking the time to leave thoughtful comments can help to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >build your presence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> within the online community. Other creators will notice you as you become a regular viewer and this will lead to them going to your channel and watching your videos (without you having to ask!).</p><p>You might even be able to create opportunities to collaborate with other creators by first becoming a fan of theirs. Collaboration videos allow you to cross-promote your content and attract new viewers and subscribers.</p><h2 id="4-Tackle-the-Latest-YouTube-Trends"><a href="#4-Tackle-the-Latest-YouTube-Trends" class="headerlink" title="4. Tackle the Latest YouTube Trends"></a><strong>4. Tackle the Latest YouTube Trends</strong></h2><p>New <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >trends are important to jump on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially when other YouTube creators are having success with videos on a particular set of trends. If there is a worldwide issue going on, a new and popular game, or a meme that everyone is making jokes about, you should consider making your own type of video related to that trend. Trending content almost always earns plenty of views because people search out content related to the trend they’re interested in. Covering a trend can bring in a whole new audience for your channel.</p><p>You can find trending topics to make videos on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or by checking out the popular channels in your genre to see if there’s a trend they’re all jumping on. When you cover a trend, always try to bring in your own original spin to stand out from the multitude of other videos covering the same trend.</p><h2 id="5-Optimizing-your-Content-for-Keywords"><a href="#5-Optimizing-your-Content-for-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimizing your Content for Keywords"></a><strong>5. Optimizing your Content for Keywords</strong></h2><p>Every piece of content that you produce for YouTube needs to be appropriately optimized with keywords. This means writing a full description that includes your 3 most important keywords in your first 3 lines, including a large number of appropriate tags and using your most important keyword in your title.</p><p>Do some keyword research to figure out what viewers who might enjoy your video will be typing into the search bar. You can start by searching for the topic of your video (i.e. ‘iPhone X review) and seeing what kinds of words are used in the titles and descriptions of the highest-ranked videos (or <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check out these keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You can even see the tags of other people’s videos using a free Chrome extension called VidIQ.</p><h2 id="6-Use-Keywords-in-your-Video-File-Names"><a href="#6-Use-Keywords-in-your-Video-File-Names" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Keywords in your Video File Names"></a><strong>6. Use Keywords in your Video File Names</strong></h2><p>A commonly overlooked area for optimization is the file names of YouTube videos. Many YouTube creators simply have generic filenames for all of the videos that they upload on the platform, such as ‘youtubevideo54.mp4’. Saving your files with names like this is actually a huge missed opportunity.</p><p>Consider renaming your video file to reflect your keyword-optimized video title. Including keywords within your file names will make sure that even the file itself will be indexed properly in a Google video search. This is a very quick, easy, way to increase your search ranking and get more views on YouTube.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148636/16836" target="_top" id="2148636">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148636" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148636/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Write-Titles-that-are-Click-Worthy"><a href="#7-Write-Titles-that-are-Click-Worthy" class="headerlink" title="7. Write Titles that are Click-Worthy"></a><strong>7. Write Titles that are Click-Worthy</strong></h2><p>A title on a YouTube video needs to work just as effectively as any other headline on the internet. You need to be able to capture the attention of your audience and generate excitement while still using important keywords and letting your viewers know exactly what your video is about. Mysterious clickbait titles only work for channels that are already big.</p><p>Having the ability to write excellent titles that also carry keyword information that is relevant to your niche will take practice. In order for a title to be click-worthy, it needs to demonstrate a clear benefit for the viewer. A ‘clear benefit’ might be a skill the viewer will learn or information they will gain. Creating a sense of urgency in the title will also help to attract more clicks, and that can be done by using words like ‘now’ or ‘today’.</p><h2 id="8-Use-Lots-of-Tags"><a href="#8-Use-Lots-of-Tags" class="headerlink" title="8. Use Lots of Tags"></a><strong>8. Use Lots of Tags</strong></h2><p>Every YouTube user is limited to 426 characters for the total number of tags that they can include, and you should try to use as much of that space as you can. The more tags you use, the more potential searches YouTube might add your video to.</p><p>It’s important to have high converting tags that will generate a fair amount of viewership. By trying out a wide variety of tags related to your videos in the early days of your YouTube channel you will start to see which perform the best for you. You can then start making videos that target those tags in a more focused manner. As you start to do research into keywords and the types of tags that work best for your channel, you can eventually zero in on some of the best tags that you can use with all of your content moving forward.</p><h2 id="9-Write-a-Thorough-Description-for-Every-Piece-of-Content"><a href="#9-Write-a-Thorough-Description-for-Every-Piece-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="9. Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content"></a><strong>9. Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content</strong></h2><p>The description that you post alongside your video is often one of the greatest ways that you can index your video in search engine results. Video content is starting to gain an extensive amount of traction especially when it comes to the way that it’s indexed in Google’s video search engine results. In order for your YouTube video to rank well within the search engine results, you need to have a thorough description.</p><p>A thorough description means doing keyword research as well as using the maximum number of characters that you can for the description. The largest YouTube descriptions that you might see are around 900 words. That means plenty of opportunities to use keywords within the content and help index the page in search engine results. Google will index the entire description just as it would any other webpage content so including a full transcription of your video or a detailed description of the content that’s in your video will help you to capture a huge audience and increase your YouTube views.</p><h2 id="10-Learn-From-the-Success-of-Your-Best-Performing-Videos"><a href="#10-Learn-From-the-Success-of-Your-Best-Performing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="10. Learn From the Success of Your Best Performing Videos"></a><strong>10. Learn From the Success of Your Best Performing Videos</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Checking the analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of your channel regularly is important for creators both big and small. The analytics in your Creator Studio can tell you who’s watching your videos, which videos have the best watch time, and even which videos attract the newest subscribers.</p><p>When you know which videos are the most successful at getting people to subscribe, you can figure out why (perhaps it was the way you asked?) and replicate that method in your future videos. This will earn you more views over time because subscribers will watch more of your content.</p><p>You should also try to replicate the methods you used to get higher watch times in the videos that perform well in that regard. Improving your watch time will get you higher search engine rankings and more views.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528689/16446" target="_top" id="1528689">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528689" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528689/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="11-Embed-Videos-in-your-Blog-Website"><a href="#11-Embed-Videos-in-your-Blog-Website" class="headerlink" title="11. Embed Videos in your Blog&#x2F;Website"></a><strong>11. Embed Videos in your Blog&#x2F;Website</strong></h2><p>Starting your own personal blog or website and embedding your videos within text posts is a great way to get more views. Views gathered outside of YouTube count too, and creating a web page means that there’s one more way for people to find your content in their search results.</p><p>If you do not have a blog and do not want to start one, consider whether you can get your videos embedded on someone else’s website or blog. It’s easiest to ask a friend, but you could also try to reach out to a blogger in your niche who doesn’t have their own YouTube channel. Explain that having a video embedded in their post might be useful for their readers, and can help to boost their session time which will be good for their search engine rankings.</p><h2 id="12-Share-your-Videos-on-Social-Media"><a href="#12-Share-your-Videos-on-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="12. Share your Videos on Social Media"></a><strong>12. Share your Videos on Social Media</strong></h2><p>The YouTube community is quite a large one on its own but it doesn’t hurt to extend your social reach by <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >starting social media pages for your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well. Having an official Twitter or Instagram that is connected to your YouTube account can really help you to share your videos with a wider audience and ensure that you can capture views from many different sources at once.</p><p>Social media accounts also help you hold your subscribers’ attention across multiple platforms. Make sure you’re providing some additional value on social media and not just posting links to your videos (i.e. behind the scenes photos).</p><p>Building up social media pages will give you plenty of new search engine results with indexed content as well.</p><p>Most successful YouTube creators also have links to their social media accounts all across their channel banner and they regularly share their videos as soon as they are posted over their social media accounts so that their followers share their video too.</p><p>You should sign up for every social media platform you can think of with your channel name, just so that nobody else can use it, but you only need to actively use the platforms that are relevant to your audience. For example, lifestyle YouTubers should be on Instagram but gamers don’t need to be.</p><p> These are all <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >methods that anyone can use for free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Choose a Topic you Love"></a>1. Choose a Topic you Love</h4><p>When choosing a topic for your YouTube channel make sure you pick something you are passionate about. If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p><p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular. Follow your passion.</p><h4 id="2-Check-out-the-Competition"><a href="#2-Check-out-the-Competition" class="headerlink" title="2. Check out the Competition"></a>2. Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-a-Great-Name"><a href="#3-Choose-a-Great-Name" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose a Great Name"></a>3. Choose a Great Name</h4><p>Picking a great name for your YouTube account can take a lot of effort. Chances are you will not want to use your own name, at least not in full. Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p><p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow. Brainstorm a long list of potential names that are actually good and keep on trying them out until you find one that’s available.</p><p>For more information on naming your YouTube channel read our post ‘How To Pick a Name for Your YouTube Channel’.</p><h4 id="4-Make-a-Schedule"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule"></a>4. Make a Schedule</h4><p>Maintaining a YouTube channel is a big time commitment. You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p><p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like. They are more likely to subscribe and tune in for every post if they are given a chance to anticipate when your new entry is coming.</p><h4 id="5-Take-Inventory"><a href="#5-Take-Inventory" class="headerlink" title="5. Take Inventory"></a>5. Take Inventory</h4><p>Think about what equipment you have that you can use for your YouTube channel. The only thing you absolutely cannot get by without is a decent camera, but there are other types of equipment that it is a good idea to have too. Lights, a tripod, an external microphone – these are all things that a lot of YouTubers find they need in order to produce great videos. If you do not have these things, or money you are prepared to invest in them, then you will need to find ways around them until your situation changes.

This is due to a variety of circumstances. YouTube TV is simple to use. It has a channel lineup that is competitive with all of the others.</p><p>In addition, the YouTube TV price is reasonable. You can watch YouTube TV on almost any current gadget. And the fact that parent company Alphabet (aka Google) has been heavily marketing it over the last few years hasn’t hurt either.</p><p>A lot is going on with YouTube TV, and it’s only gotten better with time.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Watch YouTube TV?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Is Youtube Tv A Good Investment?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Frequently Asked Questions About Youtube TV</a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Exactly-Does-Youtube-Tv-Entail"><a href="#What-Exactly-Does-Youtube-Tv-Entail" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?"></a>What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?</h2><p>YouTube TV, in a nutshell, is a live TV streaming service available in the United States. It’s an Internet-based replacement for cable or satellite television that works on phones, tablets, TVs, and web browsers, allowing you to watch TV, in the same manner you always have from anywhere you have an internet connection, whether at home or on the road.</p><p>When it first started in 2017, YouTube TV was limited to a small number of areas in the United States. That changed in 2019 when a significant expansion included support for all 210 markets. It has also substantially grown its channel library throughout the years. There are currently over 85 stations available on YouTube TV, including four major national broadcasters: ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox.</p><p>Despite its name, YouTube TV is not a part of YouTube; Google maintains both as different companies. However, there are some instances where the two overlap, such as with YouTube Originals, which essentially means that you may end up viewing a few series on both platforms. Nonetheless, YouTube TV is not the same as YouTube, and you’ll need two apps on your streaming device to access both.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-tv-1.jpg"                      alt="youtube tv"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Watch-YouTube-TV"><a href="#How-to-Watch-YouTube-TV" class="headerlink" title="How to Watch YouTube TV?"></a>How to Watch YouTube TV?</h2><h4 id="Using-a-computer"><a href="#Using-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Using a computer"></a>Using a computer</h4><ol><li>Ensure that your computer is on the same Wi-Fi network as Chromecast.</li><li>Open your favorite browser and navigate to tv.youtube.com.</li><li>Choose the show or movie that you wish to watch.</li><li>When the video has loaded, click the Cast icon.

YouTube TV has proven to be one of the greatest live TV streaming services, with an excellent channel selection and an unrivaled user experience, since its introduction in 2017.</p><p>While the price has nearly risen since then, it is still a better option than any of its premium competitors, including Hulu Plus Live TV, FuboTV, and DirecTV Stream. Aside from channels, YouTube TV is simple to use, stylish, and fast on a range of TV and mobile devices. Its cloud DVR is the best in the business, with unlimited storage and nearly all of the features of a hardware DVR like TiVo.</p><h4 id="What-can-you-get-from-YouTube-TV"><a href="#What-can-you-get-from-YouTube-TV" class="headerlink" title="What can you get from YouTube TV?"></a>What can you get from YouTube TV?</h4><p>YouTube TV is distinct from YouTube, the free video site with over 2 billion monthly users. With live channels and on-demand programmers available on a variety of devices, YouTube TV offers a similar experience to cable television. It is compatible with Apple TV, Roku, Android TV, Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV, and various other smart TVs, phones, tablets, and web browsers.</p><h4 id="Which-networks-are-supported-by-Youtube-TV"><a href="#Which-networks-are-supported-by-Youtube-TV" class="headerlink" title="Which networks are supported by Youtube TV?"></a>Which networks are supported by Youtube TV?</h4><p>YouTube TV allows you to watch live and local sports, news, and entertainment from more than 70 channels, including ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, HGTV, TNT, and others. YouTube TV also offers local and regional content, providing complete local network coverage in over 98 percent of US TV households. YouTube TV is an online streaming service that allows customers to watch live television on computers, phones, and other compatible devices. It requires a high-speed internet connection and is a practical alternative to cable television for those wishing to cut the cord.</p><p>YouTube TV offers a variety of paid add-on channels. These are channels that need a fee in addition to the regular YouTube TV fee. However, this is the greatest method for accessing uncut and unedited movies on YouTube TV.</p><p>The following are among the premium add-on channels available on YouTube TV:</p><p>ALLBLK ($5 per month), AMC+ ($7 per month), Acorn TV ($6 per month), Cinemax ($10 per month), ($5&#x2F;month) Comedy Dynamics, CONtv ($5 per month), CuriosityStream ($3 per month), Docurama ($5 per month), Dove ($5 per month), EPIX ($6 per month), Fandor ($4 per month), Fox Nation ($6 per month), Hallmark Movies Now ($6 per month) and so on.</p><h4 id="Price-and-Add-ons-for-Youtube-TV"><a href="#Price-and-Add-ons-for-Youtube-TV" class="headerlink" title="Price and Add-ons for Youtube TV"></a>Price and Add-ons for Youtube TV</h4><p>The current monthly fee for YouTube TV is USD 65, Plus tax, which brings the total to around $72 each month)</p><p>That isn’t to imply that’s the only price you’ll ever pay for YouTube TV. It has various alternative add-ons that offer you access to even more episodes, movies, and sports for a cost. The option to view some shows and sports in 4K on YouTube TV is a new huge one.</p><p>The following are the optional add-ons for YouTube TV:</p><h4 id="4k-plus-20-per-month-after-a-one-month-trial-9-99-for-the-first-year-for-early-adopters"><a href="#4k-plus-20-per-month-after-a-one-month-trial-9-99-for-the-first-year-for-early-adopters" class="headerlink" title="4k plus ($20 per month after a one-month trial; $9.99 for the first year for early adopters)"></a>4k plus ($20 per month after a one-month trial; $9.99 for the first year for early adopters)</h4><p>On-demand shows and series such as What We Do in the Shadows, Struggle Meals, American Titans, Snowfall, and others fall under this category.

Focus on the technical aspects of your YouTube video before you actually start shooting and strive to be well prepared for all the challenges a day on the set may bring.</p><p> These and other useful tips may help you make better videos for your YouTube channel, so let’s explore different ways of improving your video making skills.</p><h2 id="10-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#10-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos"></a>10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos</h2><p> All videographers agree that you shouldn’t come to the set unprepared. Everything has to be in its place, no matter how insignificant it may seem, because a tiny detail can completely ruin the shot or even an entire day of work. These tips are going to help you avoid common mistakes, inexperienced video producers often make.</p><h4 id="1-Write-the-Script"><a href="#1-Write-the-Script" class="headerlink" title="1. Write the Script"></a>1. Write the Script</h4><p> Everything starts with a script, at least in the cinematography world. You don’t have to write long, detailed descriptions of all scenes, just make a short note of every scene, what is being said in the shot, on-screen actions, camera positions, and so on. By doing this, you’ll save yourself a lot of valuable time, you can then dedicate to other burning issues on the set. Besides, knowing what you are going to say throughout the video so you don’t have to improvise all the time is going to help you feel more relaxed in front of a camera.</p><h4 id="2-Build-the-Set-Lighting-included"><a href="#2-Build-the-Set-Lighting-included" class="headerlink" title="2. Build the Set (Lighting included)"></a>2. Build the Set (Lighting included)</h4><p> Don’t leave anything to chance. You should control everything that is going to be in the shot, so avoid working at locations you can’t at least partially control. Shooting in studio-like conditions will enable you to carefully select the scenography and to design light so it matches the scene perfectly. The actors must always be clearly visible to the audience, which is why you need to pay attention to where they are located in the shot and how much light you have in that part of the shot.</p><h4 id="3-Keep-Your-Batteries-Charged"><a href="#3-Keep-Your-Batteries-Charged" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep Your Batteries Charged"></a>3. Keep Your Batteries Charged</h4><p> There is nothing more frustrating than arriving at the set anxious to start shooting just to find out that the batteries are empty. Charge the batteries at the end of each day on the set, because the chances are that you are going to need them early in the morning. Always have several spare batteries with you, so even if one battery is empty you have the replacement ready. You can also prolong the battery life by switching the camera off when you are not recording.</p><h4 id="4-Do-a-Microphone-Check"><a href="#4-Do-a-Microphone-Check" class="headerlink" title="4. Do a Microphone Check"></a>4. Do a Microphone Check</h4><p> Capturing audio with an external microphone drastically increases the quality of the sound in your videos. That’s why making absolutely sure that all cables are connected and that the microphone is perfectly placed is paramount if you want to get the sound right. The host or the hosts of the video must be at the right distance from the microphone, usually, the length of their fist with the thumb and pinky finger extended, but this can vary a few inches to either side.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/best-microphone-for-youtuber-videos.html" >Check out the best microphone for YouTuber in 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Pay-Attention-to-The-Shot-Composition"><a href="#5-Pay-Attention-to-The-Shot-Composition" class="headerlink" title="5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition"></a>5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition</h4><p> The rule of thirds is a common composition principle used by videographers to create balanced and unified images. The rule suggests that the subjects in a shot should be placed at the intersections of the lines that divide the screen. Most digital cameras have a grid that makes using the rule of thirds quite simple because you can easily see when the subjects in the shot are not positioned correctly.</p><p> This is just one of many shot composition techniques you have at your disposal, and as you gain more experience you’ll learn how to combine them and get aesthetically pleasing results.</p><h4 id="6-Always-Record-Videos-in-Landscape-Mode"><a href="#6-Always-Record-Videos-in-Landscape-Mode" class="headerlink" title="6.

YouTubers who record their videos with Smartphones are more likely to fall into this trap, but all you need to do to avoid this is remember to hold the device horizontally.</p><p> By switching to portrait mode, you’ll be cropping the frame in a way, so you might unknowingly end up removing parts of the shot you wanted to record.</p><p> In case that you want to convert your portrait video to landscape, do not miss this article about <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/convert-portrait-video-to-landscape.html" >How to Convert A Portrait Video to Landscape. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises"><a href="#7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="7. Eliminate The Background Noises"></a>7. Eliminate The Background Noises</h4><p> Professional microphones can pick up even the softest sounds, that might prove difficult to remove in the post-production. You can reduce the noise levels in your videos by using shotgun microphones that only capture sounds that come directly into the microphone, or by using the omnidirectional mic to eliminate the wind if you’re shooting on an outdoor location.</p><p> Background noises can be particularly unpleasant when recording narration, because the viewers of the video may not want to watch it until the end if they can’t hear what the person in the video is saying.</p><p> If it is hard for you to record your YouTube video in quite environment, you can <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/remove-background-noise-from-video.html" >remove the background noise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by using some video editing software.

Keep The Shot in Focus"></a>8. Keep The Shot in Focus</h4><p> You can always keep the shot in focus by simply enabling the autofocus feature, but if you do so you won’t be able to control where the focus is going to be. Pulling focus manually is an art that takes years to master, and you have to keep practicing it as much as you can in order to become good at it.</p><p> The best way to deal with out of focus shots is to avoid shooting scenes that include a lot of action because you won’t have to pull focus that often.</p><h4 id="9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod"><a href="#9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="9.

All video cameras pick up vibrations easily, so even the slightest movement or impact can ruin a shot. Putting the camera on a tripod is one of the best ways to stabilize the shot and avoid camera shaking.</p><p> In addition, a tripod enables you to maintain image stability even when shooting form lower or upper angles, something that cannot be achieved by simply holding the camera.</p><p> We have chosen some of the <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/how-to-use-tripod-for-vlogging.html" >best tripods that you can use for starting a YouTube vlogging Video shooting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Their goal is to create YouTube as a global platform for sharing videos. A huge $1.65 billion was paid by Google for buying YouTube. YouTube then became a more popular website with over two billion users every month.</p><p>Lots of creators, like makeup artists and gamers, make money on YouTube.

Dailymotion became one of the most popular video platforms in France and then Europe in just 1 year. You can upload and share videos on Dailymotion like on YouTube. There is a slight difference in their focus. Dailymotion’s content tends to be professional, while YouTube’s is user-made.</p><p>Dailymotion has over 300 million users every month. It’s accessible in 35 different languages. Also, for pro content, it offers features like “Motionmaker” to users and live streaming to creators.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-3.jpg"                      alt="dailymotion: what is it"                ></p><h3 id="The-popularity-and-user-base-of-YouTube-and-Dailymotion"><a href="#The-popularity-and-user-base-of-YouTube-and-Dailymotion" class="headerlink" title="The popularity and user base of YouTube and Dailymotion"></a>The popularity and user base of YouTube and Dailymotion</h3><p>YouTube’s user interface is very easy and simple to use. You can filter the results with date and popularity at the top bar of the website. You can watch YouTube without ads and gain access to YouTube analytics.</p><p>It’s cool to create your own channel on YouTube. It allows you to upload videos, customize your banner, and create a community.</p><p>It is easy to stream videos or share them with friends by creating playlists. YouTube and Dailymotion both have easy-to-use interfaces. You can customize your own channel, and it has categories and channels. YouTube has advanced playlist features, but Dailymotion does not.</p><p>It’s not all fun and games - YouTube has fewer ads than Dailymotion. A premium subscription to Dailymotion removes the ads and gives you access to other features.</p><h3 id="Both-Platforms-have-Different-Content-and-Audiences"><a href="#Both-Platforms-have-Different-Content-and-Audiences" class="headerlink" title="Both Platforms have Different Content and Audiences"></a>Both Platforms have Different Content and Audiences</h3><h4 id="YouTube-Content-and-Audience"><a href="#YouTube-Content-and-Audience" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Content and Audience"></a>YouTube Content and Audience</h4><p>Video content on YouTube ranges from cooking tips to music videos. It even offers live streaming concerts and mind-blowing documentaries. Gamer, beauty, sports, and learning enthusiasts will enjoy this channel.</p><p>YouTube allows you to upload 12-hour-long videos to increase your watch time. You can also share all types of experiences in the long video. Every day, 2.51 billion active users watch over one billion hours of content. Creators can showcase their work in high definition, up to 8K, on the platform, which is a major advantage. Mobile devices and smartphones also allow offline viewing of videos.</p><h4 id="Dailymotion-Content-and-Audience"><a href="#Dailymotion-Content-and-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Dailymotion Content and Audience"></a>Dailymotion Content and Audience</h4><p>There’s something special about Dailymotion. The site provides YouTube videos, animated shorts, music, documentaries, and TV shows. Although Dailymotion has upload limits, its videos are still of high quality, up to 1080p. There is a vibrant community of creators looking to connect with their audiences as well. There were 545.3 million visits to Dailymotion in April 2023, making it a strong competitor. Depending on your taste and the content you’re looking for, you can choose either.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-vs-Dailymotion-Monetization-Unraveling-the-Key-Differences"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-vs-Dailymotion-Monetization-Unraveling-the-Key-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Dailymotion has fewer monetization options than YouTube. Unlike YouTube, Dailymotion allows creators to earn money through ads.</p><p>The Dailymotion Partner Program has made several French video creators extremely wealthy. The CPM is always low for video creators around the world, for whatever reason. Dailymotion Partners from France earn 3000 - 4000 euros per month. Global Partners withdraw the monthly least of $100.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-4.jpg"                      alt="programs and options for dailymotion monetization"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424528">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424528.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424528">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424528.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424528%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424528/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135315/14409" target="_top" id="2135315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2135315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135315/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Monetization-Requirements-and-Earning-Potential"><a href="#Monetization-Requirements-and-Earning-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Monetization Requirements and Earning Potential"></a>Monetization Requirements and Earning Potential</h3><p>YouTube’s YPP monetizes accounts with 1,000 subscribers and earns revenue through advertising. You’ll get 55% of the revenue generated by the ads shown during, before, and after your videos. It is also possible to charge channel memberships. For every 1,000 views, the average YouTuber makes about $18.</p><p>The Dailymotion Partner Program monetizes your videos.

Looking at channels that have millions of subscribers or videos that have God knows how many daily views may prompt you to start thinking about buying subscribers for your YouTube channel.</p><p>There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not this is a legitimate method of promoting the organic growth of your channel. A lot of people think buying subscribers and viewers is more damaging than it is helpful for YouTubers who opt to go down that road.</p><p>Before buying subscribers or views you first must make sure that the provider you’re considering doing business with is trustworthy. It may turn out that the service you purchased subscribers from is a scam designed to take your money. Besides being scammed, there are several other major concerns that make buying subscribers for your YouTube channel a questionable choice.</p><p>Let’s have a look at how buying subscribers may hurt your channel and ruin your chances of achieving YouTube success.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned"><a href="#The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned" class="headerlink" title="The Odds of Getting Banned"></a>The Odds of Getting Banned</h2><p>If you’re considering buying subscribers, your most pressing question might be “Will I get banned?” This is completely within reason because your first concern should be to avoid being penalized by YouTube.</p><p>If YouTube’s algorithm catches you buying fake views, your video will be removed. We should specify that “fake views” means “views generated by a bot.”</p><p>Buying real human views is a bit of a grey area — not technically against the rules, but frowned upon and potentially risky if the delivery of the views results makes YouTube think you’re using a bot.</p><h4 id="What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views"><a href="#What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views" class="headerlink" title="What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views"></a>What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views</h4><p>If your video is removed for artificially inflating your view count you can try to restore it by filling out the <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168?hl=en" >YouTube View Abuse Appeal Form <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Even if you manage to restore your video, your channel will get a red flag — not the kind you get for copyright violation, but an internal one that keeps the YouTube’s algorithm alert in case you try to do the same thing again.</p><p>Being caught more than once gaming the system may result in your videos being permanently removed or your channel being completely suspended. When providers of views and subscribers advertise their services as safe they are actually saying that their service will not raise red flags with YouTube’s algorithm.</p><p>The only way in which they can guarantee that is if they intend on delivering high retention views, which means that actual people will click on your video and watch it from the beginning until the end. There are services that have proven to deliver this level of quality, and if you are interested you should check out <a href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>Buy Views Review</strong></a>, which is a site that tests and rates these services.</p><p>Buying subscribers is riskier than buying views, but there are still some services that are better than others.</p><h4 id="What-to-Consider-When-Buying-YouTube-Subscribers"><a href="#What-to-Consider-When-Buying-YouTube-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="What to Consider When Buying YouTube Subscribers"></a>What to Consider When Buying YouTube Subscribers</h4><p>While purchasing subscribers for a YouTube channel that doesn’t really make money is looked upon relatively lightly, buying views or subscribers to gain profit is an entirely different matter.</p><p>As you probably already know, YouTube videos are monetized through AdSense, which has far stricter rules about attempts to trick the system. Getting caught by AdSense may result in being banned from using AdSense, which means that your account will be suspended and you will not be allowed to open another account.</p><p>Buying fake views and subscribers to try and turn a profit involves a lot of risks, especially because the financial gain you will be able to make isn’t significant. There are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >other ways to make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than to get subscribers.</p><p>The best advice for YouTube creators who want to buy views and subscribers is to go through official channels. The reason for buying real views isn’t technically against the rules is because Google could be said to sell views itself through its ad services. Paying Google for YouTube views is highly unlikely to backfire on you, while you can also consider hiring freelancers to get you legitimate subscribers and views, the quality of their services can range from excellent to terrible and it will be hard to find reliable reviews.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1743243">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1743243.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1743243">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1743243.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Faligracehair.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1743243%2F19272'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1743243/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Other-Risks-of-Buying-Subscribers"><a href="#Other-Risks-of-Buying-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Other Risks of Buying Subscribers"></a>Other Risks of Buying Subscribers</h2><p>Besides getting into trouble with YouTube, there are other risks involved with buying subscribers.</p><p>The whole idea behind buying fake subscribers is to make your channel look more popular to attract real subscribers, but in order to attract real subscribers, your videos need to rank in YouTube’s search engine. There are legitimate optimization tactics that can help you do that, but it does require more patience.</p><p>The amount of time viewers spend watching your video is the most important statistic for determining how well ranked your videos are in search queries on YouTube and if you buy fake views or fake subscribers, the viewer retention rates will remain the same.</p><h4 id="Why-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-Are-a-Waste-of-Money"><a href="#Why-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-Are-a-Waste-of-Money" class="headerlink" title="Why Fake YouTube Subscribers Are a Waste of Money"></a>Why Fake YouTube Subscribers Are a Waste of Money</h4><p>Buying fake subscribers won’t help get your videos in front of real viewers.</p><p>Your channel and your videos will continue to perform poorly in the search results as long as the viewer retention rates remain low. This is because buying subscribers doesn’t mean that you will be buying views or watch time.</p><p>In most cases, subscribers who you have paid for will not watch your videos. If your subscriber count suddenly shoots up, but your view count and watch time does not reflect that growth, YouTube’s algorithm will pick up on that. You may not face any official disciplinary action, but the algorithm will ensure that your videos are ranked very low in search results making it impossible to grow.</p><h4 id="Alternative-to-Buying-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers"><a href="#Alternative-to-Buying-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Alternative to Buying Fake YouTube Subscribers"></a>Alternative to Buying Fake YouTube Subscribers</h4><p>The best strategy is to grow your channel organically, even though it will take a lot of time. Create a community that loves and follows your work and you will never have to think about how to get fake subscribers.</p><p>If you would like to avoid even the slightest possibility of your channel getting hurt, create content that YouTube viewers will enjoy watching or find helpful, and keep making them consistently. It might take a long time, but you will start to see growth.</p><p>This is the best way to develop a loyal fan base that will help you get more subscribers. Views and subscribers you get from bot farms, which is where most of the bought subscribers and views come from, maybe excellent at imitating the human online behavior, but there will be consequences if you get caught.</p><p>Buying subscribers is unlikely to have a huge effect on the growth rate of your channel. Also, this method for increasing traffic on your channel will not take you a step closer to creating a community of subscribers who can’t wait to watch your next video, which should be the ultimate goal of every aspiring YouTube creator.</p><p>In conclusion, we don’t recommend that you buy fake YouTube subscribers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139107/17108" target="_top" id="2139107">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139107" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139107/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Make-Impressive-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora-to-Grow-Your-Subscriber"><a href="#Make-Impressive-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora-to-Grow-Your-Subscriber" class="headerlink" title="Make Impressive YouTube Video with Filmora to Grow Your Subscriber"></a>Make Impressive YouTube Video with Filmora to Grow Your Subscriber</h2><p>Since YouTube is a video platform, your video is what attracts your subscribers.

The following is a list of the <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>3 best YouTube name generators</strong></a>, an easy step-by-step for <strong>brainstorming</strong>, and instructions for updating your YouTube name.</p><p>Whether you’re a YouTuber beginner or want to improve your YouTube videos to the next level, a good <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be a good helper. Wondershare Filmora is a video editor for all YouTube creators with plentiful effects and templates, and you can download it directly and have a try before purchasing.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><hr><ol><li><a href="#generators">YouTube Name Generators</a></li><li><a href="#goodname">How to Come Up With a Good YouTube Name</a></li><li><a href="#changename">How to Change Your YouTube Name</a></li><li><a href="#custom">Requesting a Custom URL for YouTube</a></li></ol><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-3-Awesome-YouTube-Name-Generators"><a href="#Part-1-3-Awesome-YouTube-Name-Generators" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 3 Awesome YouTube Name Generators"></a>Part 1: 3 Awesome YouTube Name Generators</h2><p>Need some help brainstorming your channel name? Here are 3 tools for getting started. Even if you don’t use one of the names you generate you’ll get some great inspiration.</p><h4 id="1-SpinXO"><a href="#1-SpinXO" class="headerlink" title="1. SpinXO"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="http://www.spinxo.com/youtube-names/" >SpinXO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> - Lots of options</p><p> - Checks availability</p><p>This is a great generator. If you were brainstorming yourself, you’d probably write out a bunch of words related to yourself and the kinds of videos you want to make and see what goes together. SpinXO does that for you, and mixes in other words that sound good in usernames.</p><p>Here’s what happened when I tried to name a hypothetical baking channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><p>Not all of the results are great, but there are some cool sounding options in there.</p><p>One of the most useful features of SpinXO is that you can check the availability of the usernames. I liked the sound of CupcakesCupola, and when I clicked on it I was able to see that nobody else was using it on other sites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><h4 id="2-Name-Generator"><a href="#2-Name-Generator" class="headerlink" title="2. Name Generator"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="http://www.namegenerator.biz/youtube-name-generator.php" >Name Generator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can be hilarious</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Names tend to be a bit long</p><p>This is a fairly limited generator. You plunk in a prefix and a suffix, and it generates a random word or term to stuff between them. Here’s what I got for my fictional cupcake channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>So, on one hand - that’s hilarious and I’m considering legally changing my name. On the other hand, all of the results look exactly like this (which means they’re all a bit too long). It shows you a longer list if you scroll down:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example-generated.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>You can pick your favorite names and it’ll list them out so you can easily copy them into a word document. That’ll be useful if you’re collecting options from several sites.</p><h4 id="3-Username-Generator"><a href="#3-Username-Generator" class="headerlink" title="3. Username Generator"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="http://namegenerators.org/username-generator/" >Username Generator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can generate a huge number of names at once</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  You only input one word</p><p>For this name generator, you type in one important word and choose how many results you want to see. You can see up to 300 at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator.jpg"                      alt="Username Generator"                ></p><p>The generator will take your keyword and add endings (and occasional beginnings) to it. Some endings are words, and some are just suffixes. Here’s what I got:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator-generated.jpg"                      alt="Username Generator Sample"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134490/18498" target="_top" id="2134490">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134490" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134490/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Come-Up-With-a-Good-YouTube-Name-–-3-Easy-Steps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Come-Up-With-a-Good-YouTube-Name-–-3-Easy-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Come Up With a Good YouTube Name – 3 Easy Steps"></a>Part 2: How to Come Up With a Good YouTube Name – 3 Easy Steps</h2><p>The name of your YouTube channel needs to accomplish two things:</p><ol><li>Tell viewers what your channel is about</li><li>Stick in viewer’s heads by being catchy and unique</li></ol><p>Here’s how you can brainstorm the perfect name for your channel!</p><h4 id="Step-1-Gather-up-relevant-words"><a href="#Step-1-Gather-up-relevant-words" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Gather up relevant words"></a><strong>Step 1: Gather up relevant words</strong></h4><p>Open up a journal (or a word document) and start writing down words that relate to you and your channel.</p><p>You may want to make one list of ‘you’ words (personality traits, nicknames, titles, etc.) and another of words related to your channel’s category (i.e. gaming, makeup, or baking).</p><h4 id="Step-2-Combinations"><a href="#Step-2-Combinations" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Combinations"></a><strong>Step 2: Combinations</strong></h4><p>Start combining your ‘you’ words with your category words to see what sounds good. You may want to use one of the name generators above (anchor) for this part.</p><p>Try to keep your name fairly short (3 words or less) so it’s easier for people to remember. Don’t include numbers if you can avoid it.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Say-it-out-loud"><a href="#Step-3-Say-it-out-loud" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Say it out loud"></a><strong>Step 3: Say it out loud</strong></h4><p>Once you have a shortlist of potential names, read them aloud to yourself to make sure they sound good.
