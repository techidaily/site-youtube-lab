In addition, you will be able to see how many videos they have uploaded and how many views they got.

However, if you want to learn more about a YouTube channel than its subscriber count, such as the number of videos a creator has uploaded, how many views they have received, or how many comments their videos have, then LiveCounts may not be a good choice since it only monitors subscriber numbers in real time. There is a views tool, but it does not appear to be working.</p><p>On LiveCounts you can change the color of the display background.</p><h3 id="5-Grin-co"><a href="#5-Grin-co" class="headerlink" title="5.

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

Video editing is not as complicated as it looks. In older days, certain manual processing was required to make the videotape. But today the software industry has given us well-equipped tools for video making or editing. Video editors are on huge demand in various sectors starting from academics to business professions.

To capture funny moments or to perform a funny act, certain video editing skills can be used. Then one can share these videos on the public platforms and gain praise. Social platforms like Youtube and Instagram are filled with such creative content. It gives the person a unique opportunity to show his&#x2F;her talent in front of everyone with the help of these tools. The most important thing in the case of <strong>parody video</strong> is there is no requirement of professional editing knowledge to make the creative videos.</p><p>Click here to see <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Songs That Totally Crack You Up. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The “Import” option available on the timeline will do all the procedures alone. The user will not have to worry about anything. Importing is the starting procedure of video editing. There are plenty of additional features available on the same page of the program. Once the array of files is uploaded, the files are dragged and dropped in the timeline where they will be now subjected to be produced and shared. There will be no hassle to get access to the videos. All the imported files are available in the right place. The thumbnail on the left item tray will comprise of all the videos and audio clips. The user can easily obtain them and there will be no confusion.</p><p><strong>History of Parody:</strong></p><p>The history of Parody is very old, it comes from ancient Greece. At that time Battle of the Frogs and Mice hold in which unknown poet reproduces the epic style of Homer.</p><p><strong>Successful influencer of music video parody- Bart Baker</strong></p><p>Bart Baker is the king of the video parody. <strong>Bart Baker</strong> has his own YouTube channel and there you can find his videos. Few of his videos have followers more than 100 million.</p><p><strong>Few of his videos are as below:</strong></p><ol><li>The Chainsmokers ft.

Daft Punk</strong></p><p>After listening to the vietsub, startboy saw it cursing me. After listening to the start-up bart, I saw the weeknd calling myself happy. Very nice invention.</p><p>Youtube link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOwGMpIv8LU" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOwGMpIv8LU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Why his videos are the best:</strong></p><p>Bart Baker is an American artist, web-based comedian, video producer, singer, and parody artist. He is best known for making parody videos of notable songs, which he posts on his YouTube channel. He was described as one of the most prolific creators of musical parodies by Billboard. In addition to being active on YouTube, Baker is known for his short videos on Vine and also on Live.ly, where he is the most winning broadcaster. His videos are described as “high-quality parodies that keep the originals very well.” His videos are famous because they are a great source of entertainment for users. Every age people like his videos.</p><p><strong>How to make a parody video?</strong></p><p>If you want to know <strong>how to make a parody video</strong> then follow the below steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Finding the perfect song:</strong></li><li><strong>Getting the correct music:</strong> To get the right music, Youtube will be a suitable platform.</li><li><strong>Recording suitable lyrics:</strong> The lyrics can be recorded with the help of a microphone in-built with computers. In the absence of a microphone, a video camera will do the work as a substitute. The operating system running under Windows will give the option of Windows movie maker as the recording tool. GarageBand and iMovie will serve the purpose if the user has a Mac operating device. The ultimate goal is a smooth recording. The area of the recording should be soundproof or should have minimum external noise interference. The professional studios have soundproof walls of the rooms for recording. But this is not the case here. Any quiet place is sufficiently suitable for the recording. The pitch and quality of the voice must not be too rough or too fast. Practicing for a few cycles before the final recording will be perfect.</li><li><strong>Making a music video:</strong> The newly created parody will get the maximum benefit if it collaborates with a music video. Only with the help of a video camera, the filming can be done. There should be proper sync between the music video and the parody. Before filming everything should be planned. The location of the shoot should be confirmed beforehand. The background should meet the theme of the song and parody. It is required to carry all the costumes and props to the location of the shoot. Once the video is shot, now it is time for attaching the two clips to make a single impactful video. Use powerful video editing tools to get what you want- Filmora can help you make it.</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Today Youtube is the most prominent platform where people can utilize their video editing skills.

Interaction with your audience also builds a strong following. You can nurture a community by responding to comments, particularly if one of the viewers asks a direct question. Other viewers will most likely comment on your videos when they are sure you will respond.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-watched-youtube-video-in-24-hours-2.png"                      alt="get more views on youtube - actively engage with follower"                ></p><h4 id="Use-Other-Social-Channels-to-Get-More-Views-3"><a href="#Use-Other-Social-Channels-to-Get-More-Views-3" class="headerlink" title="- Use Other Social Channels to Get More Views"></a>- Use Other Social Channels to Get More Views</h4><p>Let the followers on your other social channels know every time you upload new video on your YouTube channel. You use a short teaser video to do this. People will see the teaser video and click the link you have provided to watch the video. You can also embed the videos in relevant blogs and web pages on your site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-watched-youtube-video-in-24-hours-3.png"                      alt="get more views on youtube - use other social channel"                ></p><h4 id="Optimize-the-Titles-of-Your-Videos-3"><a href="#Optimize-the-Titles-of-Your-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="- Optimize the Titles of Your Videos"></a>- Optimize the Titles of Your Videos</h4><p>Because YouTube is a search engine, SEO is crucial if you want people to find your videos and increase your views.

Focus on the technical aspects of your YouTube video before you actually start shooting and strive to be well prepared for all the challenges a day on the set may bring.</p><p> These and other useful tips may help you make better videos for your YouTube channel, so let’s explore different ways of improving your video making skills.</p><h2 id="10-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#10-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos"></a>10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos</h2><p> All videographers agree that you shouldn’t come to the set unprepared. Everything has to be in its place, no matter how insignificant it may seem, because a tiny detail can completely ruin the shot or even an entire day of work. These tips are going to help you avoid common mistakes, inexperienced video producers often make.</p><h4 id="1-Write-the-Script"><a href="#1-Write-the-Script" class="headerlink" title="1. Write the Script"></a>1. Write the Script</h4><p> Everything starts with a script, at least in the cinematography world. You don’t have to write long, detailed descriptions of all scenes, just make a short note of every scene, what is being said in the shot, on-screen actions, camera positions, and so on. By doing this, you’ll save yourself a lot of valuable time, you can then dedicate to other burning issues on the set. Besides, knowing what you are going to say throughout the video so you don’t have to improvise all the time is going to help you feel more relaxed in front of a camera.</p><h4 id="2-Build-the-Set-Lighting-included"><a href="#2-Build-the-Set-Lighting-included" class="headerlink" title="2. Build the Set (Lighting included)"></a>2. Build the Set (Lighting included)</h4><p> Don’t leave anything to chance. You should control everything that is going to be in the shot, so avoid working at locations you can’t at least partially control. Shooting in studio-like conditions will enable you to carefully select the scenography and to design light so it matches the scene perfectly. The actors must always be clearly visible to the audience, which is why you need to pay attention to where they are located in the shot and how much light you have in that part of the shot.</p><h4 id="3-Keep-Your-Batteries-Charged"><a href="#3-Keep-Your-Batteries-Charged" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep Your Batteries Charged"></a>3. Keep Your Batteries Charged</h4><p> There is nothing more frustrating than arriving at the set anxious to start shooting just to find out that the batteries are empty. Charge the batteries at the end of each day on the set, because the chances are that you are going to need them early in the morning. Always have several spare batteries with you, so even if one battery is empty you have the replacement ready. You can also prolong the battery life by switching the camera off when you are not recording.</p><h4 id="4-Do-a-Microphone-Check"><a href="#4-Do-a-Microphone-Check" class="headerlink" title="4. Do a Microphone Check"></a>4. Do a Microphone Check</h4><p> Capturing audio with an external microphone drastically increases the quality of the sound in your videos. That’s why making absolutely sure that all cables are connected and that the microphone is perfectly placed is paramount if you want to get the sound right. The host or the hosts of the video must be at the right distance from the microphone, usually, the length of their fist with the thumb and pinky finger extended, but this can vary a few inches to either side.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/best-microphone-for-youtuber-videos.html" >Check out the best microphone for YouTuber in 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Pay-Attention-to-The-Shot-Composition"><a href="#5-Pay-Attention-to-The-Shot-Composition" class="headerlink" title="5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition"></a>5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition</h4><p> The rule of thirds is a common composition principle used by videographers to create balanced and unified images. The rule suggests that the subjects in a shot should be placed at the intersections of the lines that divide the screen. Most digital cameras have a grid that makes using the rule of thirds quite simple because you can easily see when the subjects in the shot are not positioned correctly.</p><p> This is just one of many shot composition techniques you have at your disposal, and as you gain more experience you’ll learn how to combine them and get aesthetically pleasing results.</p><h4 id="6-Always-Record-Videos-in-Landscape-Mode"><a href="#6-Always-Record-Videos-in-Landscape-Mode" class="headerlink" title="6.

YouTubers who record their videos with Smartphones are more likely to fall into this trap, but all you need to do to avoid this is remember to hold the device horizontally.</p><p> By switching to portrait mode, you’ll be cropping the frame in a way, so you might unknowingly end up removing parts of the shot you wanted to record.</p><p> In case that you want to convert your portrait video to landscape, do not miss this article about <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/convert-portrait-video-to-landscape.html" >How to Convert A Portrait Video to Landscape. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises"><a href="#7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="7. Eliminate The Background Noises"></a>7. Eliminate The Background Noises</h4><p> Professional microphones can pick up even the softest sounds, that might prove difficult to remove in the post-production. You can reduce the noise levels in your videos by using shotgun microphones that only capture sounds that come directly into the microphone, or by using the omnidirectional mic to eliminate the wind if you’re shooting on an outdoor location.</p><p> Background noises can be particularly unpleasant when recording narration, because the viewers of the video may not want to watch it until the end if they can’t hear what the person in the video is saying.</p><p> If it is hard for you to record your YouTube video in quite environment, you can <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/remove-background-noise-from-video.html" >remove the background noise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by using some video editing software.

Keep The Shot in Focus"></a>8. Keep The Shot in Focus</h4><p> You can always keep the shot in focus by simply enabling the autofocus feature, but if you do so you won’t be able to control where the focus is going to be. Pulling focus manually is an art that takes years to master, and you have to keep practicing it as much as you can in order to become good at it.</p><p> The best way to deal with out of focus shots is to avoid shooting scenes that include a lot of action because you won’t have to pull focus that often.</p><h4 id="9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod"><a href="#9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="9.

It’s hard to crack the top search engine rankings as a small channel. Many people on YouTube would probably love their content, but all of those views are going to already popular channels.</p><p>Many YouTubers look for alternative ways to get views for their videos, not to replace organic views, but to better position their videos to be seen by real viewers. Buying views or signing up for a view exchange platform are two methods some YouTubers consider, and another is bots.</p><p><strong>View exchange platforms are allowed, and buying views is grey, but bots are against the rules. Warning:</strong> be aware that increasing your view count with a bot is against YouTube’s Terms of Service and that if you get caught, your video will be taken down. If you still wish to learn more about bots, keep reading.

Bots automatically add views to your videos.</p><p>Setting up a bot can be as easy as using other pieces of software, and there are lots of free tutorials on YouTube for view bots.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-a-YouTube-View-Bot"><a href="#Why-Use-a-YouTube-View-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Why Use a YouTube View Bot?"></a>Why Use a YouTube View Bot?</h2><p>Bots are used to create the illusion that a video is already popular to attract real viewers who view the existing view count as ‘social proof’ of the video’s quality. The main benefit is that it is fast, easy, and usually free. There are other ways, besides bots, bot accomplishes this, but if a YouTuber is resorting to a bot, it probably means they don’t have the money to buy real human views or the time to participate in a view exchange platform.</p><p>Bots can also be used to generate comments and likes for videos.</p><h2 id="What-Else-Can-A-YouTube-View-Bot-Do"><a href="#What-Else-Can-A-YouTube-View-Bot-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?"></a>What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?</h2><p>The most effective bots come with more features than bypassing Captchas and generating views.</p><p>You can set up a YouTube bot to perform daily tasks and automate your workflow. An example might be ensuring that every video on your page gets a view and comment every day. You can also use bots (or content organization platforms) to share your videos across social media automatically. This frees you up to focus on creating quality content.</p><p>Using a bot to increase your views artificially has its dangers, but it also has the potential to kick start the organic growth of your channel. Once you start attracting real viewers and subscribers, you will not need to keep relying on a bot.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151866/7443" target="_top" id="2151866">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151866" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151866/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-There-Risks-to-Using-A-YouTube-View-Bot"><a href="#Are-There-Risks-to-Using-A-YouTube-View-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?"></a>Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?</h2><p> <strong>Yes.</strong></p><p>Bots are against YouTube’s TOS, especially for partners using AdSense (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube’s partnership program here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Suppose you are suspected of using a bot. In that case, your videos can get taken down, and you could lose the ability to monetize content (YouTube reviews channels now before they can monetize, and it will be obvious to them if you’ve used a bot to get to the 10,000 lifetime views you need for monetization). Repeated offenses could even get you banned from YouTube, and it is much easier to lose AdSense access.</p><p>The biggest danger isn’t YouTube taking your videos down, though. So long as you don’t persist after being warned, you can always recover. No, the real danger of bots is that they generate low retention views. Essentially, the views you get from a bot appear to YouTube’s algorithm as if people have clicked on your videos but haven’t watched them. The algorithm interprets that as ‘the people clicking on this don’t like it, we should rank it lower down in search results. Rather than attracting organic views, bots can make it very difficult for a real viewer to find your content.</p><p>If you are going to use a bot, you need to use it smartly and sparingly to prevent damage to your channel.</p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-Using-View-Bots-to-Increase-YouTube-Views"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Using-View-Bots-to-Increase-YouTube-Views" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Using View Bots to Increase YouTube Views"></a>Alternatives to Using View Bots to Increase YouTube Views</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857865/11832" target="_top" id="857865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857865/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Organically-Growing-Your-Channel"><a href="#1-Organically-Growing-Your-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1.

Additionally, the graphs presented offer more clarity, shortening the time a creator spends finding the information they need.</p><p>Undoubtedly, YouTube updated its Creator Studio to offer a tool that enables its users to better understand their video performance and make better content that serves YouTube’s requirements.</p><h2 id="Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta"><a href="#Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta" class="headerlink" title="Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)"></a>Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Studio Beta"                ></p><p>YouTube Studio (Beta), for many YouTubers, is now the default. However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2. Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos. This data can be used to compare the size of your subscriber base to the actual number of your audience.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features"></a>Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features</h2><p>Now that you are more familiar with the new YouTube Studio (Beta), let us dive into what you can accomplish with all the new features.</p><h4 id="1-Optimization-Tips"><a href="#1-Optimization-Tips" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimization Tips"></a>1. Optimization Tips</h4><p>In the past, there has been a lot of speculations about how creators should treat their video titles and descriptions. Well, now YouTube is letting you know exactly which area to focus on. Simply hover over any “?” icon to see the advice and click “Learn More” to go to YouTube Creator Academy to get more details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-optimization.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Beta Optimization Tips"                ></p><h4 id="2-Recent-Video-Data"><a href="#2-Recent-Video-Data" class="headerlink" title="2. Recent Video Data"></a>2. Recent Video Data</h4><p>See data and improvement tips for your latest video. If YouTube identifies a notable issue with your video, they will help you by offering tips, which you can click “Tell Me More” to look into.</p><p>YouTube wants you to know how your videos are performing in the first few days. In order for YouTube to determine whether your content is worth sharing, it wants to know how your audience is responding to it right away. This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1013424/11832" target="_top" id="1013424">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1013424" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1013424/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Analysis"></a>3. Video Analysis</h4><p>In the Classic Creator Studio, you couldn’t get an aggregated view of all the important video data on one dashboard. You would have to click to each set of analytics individually and then dive deeper. This ate up your precious content creation time and made it hard to combine insights. Now with Studio Beta, you can see all the critical data in one spot. Right away, you can see how that video is performing through different factors. This will let you know where audience retention is dropping off or which traffic source is supplying most of the views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-video-analysis.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="4-Watch-Time-Funnel"><a href="#4-Watch-Time-Funnel" class="headerlink" title="4. Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic. However, 60-70% is a great number to aim towards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-watch-time-funnel.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio Watch Time Funnel"                ></p><h4 id="5-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#5-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="5. Traffic Sources"></a>5. Traffic Sources</h4><p>YouTube now presents all the different traffic sources in one easy-to-find page in the Reach Viewer tab, so creators no longer have to click between them to analyze where their traffic is coming from. This new design is far less intimidating and messy. At a glance, you can now see where the majority of your audiences are coming from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-traffic-source.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Traffic Source"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975658">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975658.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975658">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975658.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975658%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975658/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>YouTube has always put a lot of value into its analytic tools, and with YouTube Studio Beta the features and design are continuously improving.
