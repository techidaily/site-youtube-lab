Have a great name! One of the vital decisions you have to take while beginning your vlog channel is selecting a vlog channel name. Believe it or not, your vlog channel name can impact the channel’s success, so choosing the ideal one is essential. If you’re unsure of how to have the best vlog channel names or are just looking for channel rebranding, you’ve come to the right place!</p><p>Here, we’ve 50+ lists of the best <strong>YouTube channel names for vloggers</strong>, along with sections discussing how you can select the ideal one plus their importance for the channel’s growth.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Why are Vlog Channel Names Important?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What to Consider Before Picking YouTube channel names for Vloggers?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: 50+ Vlog Channel Names Ideas in 2021</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Top 5 Free Vlog Channel Name Generators in 2021</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Versatile YouTube Vlogs Editor</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Why-are-Vlog-Channel-Names-Important"><a href="#Part-1-Why-are-Vlog-Channel-Names-Important" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why are Vlog Channel Names Important?"></a>Part 1: Why are Vlog Channel Names Important?</h2><p>Your Channel Name appears on your channel page, videos, and in YouTube’s search results.</p><p>Just like a boring title, a generic vlog channel name will not last in the viewer’s memory, precisely when there’s so much competition vying for their YouTube engagement and attention. However, using attention-grabbing, punchy words can make for an entertaining YouTube channel name for vloggers. Remember, if your YouTube channel becomes successful, this will be the name that everyone knows you.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-to-Consider-Before-Picking-YouTube-channel-names-for-Vloggers"><a href="#Part-2-What-to-Consider-Before-Picking-YouTube-channel-names-for-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What to Consider Before Picking YouTube channel names for Vloggers?"></a>Part 2: What to Consider Before Picking YouTube channel names for Vloggers?</h2><p>Selecting a vlog channel name might not be simple as it seems. There are multiple options out there, so how will you know if you’ve chosen the right one?</p><p>To help you decide better, we’ve designed a step-by-step guide that shows you exactly how to develop some excellent <strong>vlog channel name ideas</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Consider the Image You Want to Portray</strong></p><p>Vlog channel names often highlight the brand or person on the other end. While not the case for all, you will notice how many define their overall objective or mission. This can be ideal to begin when thinking of new Youtube channel names for vloggers. Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not when you select your vlog channel name.</p><p>It’s pretty vital that you, the channel owner, portray a message or an image that feels natural and provides your audience with an opportunity for best relation and recognition.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Stay Consistent with Your YouTube Niche</strong></p><p>The name you select must also reflect the niche upon which you based your channel. If you have a new channel, it can be hard to compete with more prominent vlog channels that cover important content topics. That’s why you should try to be particular and become the best at designing topics for the subject you’ve selected.</p><p>While you may get required exposure with a random name to grow your channel, it’s better, to begin with, something focal to the point.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Get a Feel for Your Target Audience</strong></p><p>Your target audience could be a huge factor in selecting the best name for a vlogging channel. Also, consider other vlog channels in the niche you’ve chosen and read through their video comments. Search out what your audience likes and vice versa. A precise scenario of your audience’s interests will allow you to choose the best name for a vlogging channel.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Keep Your Channel Name Short</strong></p><p>A YouTube channel name, or username, is max up to 60 characters, but generally, you get nowhere near that! Long channel names are not essential and can also be confusing to the viewers. They can also be tough to replicate or spell while searching. A concise, short username for your YouTube vlog channel can also give you the image of having more authority.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Make Your Channel Name Memorable</strong></p><p>Remember, if your YouTube vlog channel namebecomes excellent, this will be the name that everyone knows you by. It will be there with your videos, your playlists, and thumbnails. You don’t want a bad image that drags you downwards, but add creative writing tools like word plays, abbreviations, sibilance, alliteration, and puns to increase memorability.</p><h2 id="Part-3-50-Vlog-Channel-Names-Ideas-in-2022"><a href="#Part-3-50-Vlog-Channel-Names-Ideas-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 50+ Vlog Channel Names Ideas in 2022"></a>Part 3: 50+ Vlog Channel Names Ideas in 2022</h2><p>Strictly Cyber</p><p>Top Song Critic</p><p>Hashtag Hits</p><p>All Things Sports</p><p>The Virtual Coach</p><p>Game Hub</p><p>CyberLife</p><p>The Daily Cloud</p><p>Inner Sphere</p><p>Fashion Channel</p><p>Button Smasher</p><p>Numb thumbs</p><p>Gentle Gamer</p><p>Headset Hero</p><p>Headset Heaven</p><p>Headset Habitat &#x2F; Home</p><p>Headset Hub</p><p>Gorgeous Gamer</p><p>Avatar auditions</p><p>3D Josh</p><p>abroad broad</p><p>adventures abroad</p><p>van life</p><p>[country] life</p><p>van fan</p><p>suitcase suckers</p><p>hotel hobbyists</p><p>travel treats</p><p>transit travel</p><p>travel tricks</p><p>life (long) lovers</p><p>love [name]</p><p>lovebirds</p><p>hug my husband &#x2F; housewife &#x2F; boyfriend &#x2F; girlfriend</p><p>husband at home</p><p>cuddle my girlfriend</p><p>couples paradise</p><p>trouble in paradise</p><p>couple productions</p><p>couples therapy</p><p>in a nutshell</p><p>tutorial hero</p><p>info nuggets</p><p>[name] teaches [topic]</p><p>[topic] by [name]</p><p>learning [topic]</p><p>curiosity satisfied</p><p>[topic] academy &#x2F; school &#x2F; tutorials &#x2F; teacher &#x2F; made easy &#x2F; explained &#x2F; for beginners</p><p>edu owl</p><p>nothing too difficult</p><h2 id="Part-4-Top-5-Free-Vlog-Channel-Name-Generators-in-2022"><a href="#Part-4-Top-5-Free-Vlog-Channel-Name-Generators-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Top 5 Free Vlog Channel Name Generators in 2022"></a><strong>Part 4: Top 5 Free Vlog Channel Name Generators in 2022</strong></h2><p>There are numerous ways to personalizing a cool YouTube vlog channel nameor brainstorm fantastic vlog channel name ideas.

Here are 3 tools for getting started. Even if you don’t use one of the names you generate you’ll get some great inspiration.</p><h4 id="1-SpinXO"><a href="#1-SpinXO" class="headerlink" title="1. SpinXO"></a>1. SpinXO</h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> - Lots of options</p><p> - Checks availability</p><p>This is a great generator. If you were brainstorming yourself, you’d probably write out a bunch of words related to yourself and the kinds of videos you want to make and see what goes together. SpinXO does that for you, and mixes in other words that sound good in usernames.</p><p>Here’s what happened when I tried to name a hypothetical baking channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><p>Not all of the results are great, but there are some cool sounding options in there.</p><p>One of the most useful features of SpinXO is that you can check the availability of the usernames. I liked the sound of CupcakesCupola, and when I clicked on it I was able to see that nobody else was using it on other sites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><h4 id="2-Name-Generator"><a href="#2-Name-Generator" class="headerlink" title="2.

You plunk in a prefix and a suffix, and it generates a random word or term to stuff between them.

Video editing is not as complicated as it looks. In older days, certain manual processing was required to make the videotape. But today the software industry has given us well-equipped tools for video making or editing. Video editors are on huge demand in various sectors starting from academics to business professions. Whether making a video tutorial or a creative content, video editing software is handy. Creating funny videos is the next big thing after the comedy scenes of the movies. To capture funny moments or to perform a funny act, certain video editing skills can be used. Then one can share these videos on the public platforms and gain praise. Social platforms like Youtube and Instagram are filled with such creative content. It gives the person a unique opportunity to show his&#x2F;her talent in front of everyone with the help of these tools. The most important thing in the case of <strong>parody video</strong> is there is no requirement of professional editing knowledge to make the creative videos.</p><p>Click here to see <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Songs That Totally Crack You Up. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The “Import” option available on the timeline will do all the procedures alone. The user will not have to worry about anything. Importing is the starting procedure of video editing. There are plenty of additional features available on the same page of the program. Once the array of files is uploaded, the files are dragged and dropped in the timeline where they will be now subjected to be produced and shared. There will be no hassle to get access to the videos. All the imported files are available in the right place. The thumbnail on the left item tray will comprise of all the videos and audio clips. The user can easily obtain them and there will be no confusion.</p><p><strong>History of Parody:</strong></p><p>The history of Parody is very old, it comes from ancient Greece. At that time Battle of the Frogs and Mice hold in which unknown poet reproduces the epic style of Homer.</p><p><strong>Successful influencer of music video parody- Bart Baker</strong></p><p>Bart Baker is the king of the video parody. <strong>Bart Baker</strong> has his own YouTube channel and there you can find his videos. Few of his videos have followers more than 100 million.</p><p><strong>Few of his videos are as below:</strong></p><ol><li>The Chainsmokers ft. Halsey - “Closer” PARODY</li></ol><p> This is how many times they puffed out smoke in that song</p><p><strong>Starboy - The Weeknd ft. Daft Punk</strong></p><p>After listening to the vietsub, startboy saw it cursing me. After listening to the start-up bart, I saw the weeknd calling myself happy. Very nice invention.</p><p>Youtube link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOwGMpIv8LU" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOwGMpIv8LU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Why his videos are the best:</strong></p><p>Bart Baker is an American artist, web-based comedian, video producer, singer, and parody artist. He is best known for making parody videos of notable songs, which he posts on his YouTube channel. He was described as one of the most prolific creators of musical parodies by Billboard. In addition to being active on YouTube, Baker is known for his short videos on Vine and also on Live.ly, where he is the most winning broadcaster. His videos are described as “high-quality parodies that keep the originals very well.” His videos are famous because they are a great source of entertainment for users. Every age people like his videos.</p><p><strong>How to make a parody video?</strong></p><p>If you want to know <strong>how to make a parody video</strong> then follow the below steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Finding the perfect song:</strong></li><li><strong>Getting the correct music:</strong> To get the right music, Youtube will be a suitable platform.</li><li><strong>Recording suitable lyrics:</strong> The lyrics can be recorded with the help of a microphone in-built with computers. In the absence of a microphone, a video camera will do the work as a substitute. The operating system running under Windows will give the option of Windows movie maker as the recording tool. GarageBand and iMovie will serve the purpose if the user has a Mac operating device. The ultimate goal is a smooth recording. The area of the recording should be soundproof or should have minimum external noise interference. The professional studios have soundproof walls of the rooms for recording. But this is not the case here. Any quiet place is sufficiently suitable for the recording. The pitch and quality of the voice must not be too rough or too fast. Practicing for a few cycles before the final recording will be perfect.</li><li><strong>Making a music video:</strong> The newly created parody will get the maximum benefit if it collaborates with a music video. Only with the help of a video camera, the filming can be done. There should be proper sync between the music video and the parody. Before filming everything should be planned. The location of the shoot should be confirmed beforehand. The background should meet the theme of the song and parody. It is required to carry all the costumes and props to the location of the shoot. Once the video is shot, now it is time for attaching the two clips to make a single impactful video. Use powerful video editing tools to get what you want- Filmora can help you make it.</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Today Youtube is the most prominent platform where people can utilize their video editing skills.

Discoverability"></a><strong>1. Discoverability</strong></h4><p>Having a niche differentiates your channel from all the other ones on YouTube. There is no denying the crowded space on the video platform. Every minute, <a class="link"   href="https://merchdope.com/youtube-statistics/" >300 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If you were simply copying other YouTubers, it will be challenging to grow, as your content will be in the shadows of all the other ones.</p><h4 id="2-Consistency"><a href="#2-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="2. Consistency"></a><strong>2. Consistency</strong></h4><p>By having a consistent niche, your channel will be more coherent for those who discovered your awesome content and wants more related videos. If you don’t have a clear focus on your YouTube channel, it will be confusing for your potential fans.</p><p>For example, if you created a great video about painting, but your channel also contains videos with you playing video games, doing movie commentaries, and cooking recipes, then the viewer who discovered your painting video wouldn’t subscribe to you because she has no interest in the other topics your channel covers.</p><h4 id="3-Credibility"><a href="#3-Credibility" class="headerlink" title="3. Credibility"></a><strong>3. Credibility</strong></h4><p>In a specialized niche, you can own it and become an expert on the topic. Increasing your credibility will allow you to build trust much faster with your audience and therefore, grow at a much faster rate.</p><h2 id="Finding-Your-Niche-on-YouTube"><a href="#Finding-Your-Niche-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Finding Your Niche on YouTube"></a><strong>Finding Your Niche on YouTube</strong></h2><h4 id="What-Is-Your-Objective-On-YouTube"><a href="#What-Is-Your-Objective-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="What Is Your Objective On YouTube?"></a><strong>What Is Your Objective On YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Do you want to make money? Do you want to fuel a passion? Do you want to educate the masses?</p><p>Your intentions on YouTube can be a numbers game: you want to get views, subscribers, and make money.</p><p>Or perhaps your intentions on YouTube can be to make content for a specific audience so that you can build a community.</p><p>Moreover, you might be using YouTube as the platform to showcase your personal brand and develop a reputation that you can bring to the real world.</p><p>Once you have a clear objective for what you want to achieve on YouTube, then you can consider the tactical direction to take your channel in: finding a niche and creating content for it.</p><h4 id="What-is-Your-Passion"><a href="#What-is-Your-Passion" class="headerlink" title="What is Your Passion?"></a><strong>What is Your Passion?</strong></h4><p>Building a YouTube channel is a grind and if you are not passionate about the topics you are covering in your niche, you may not have the motivation needed to churn out videos day after day, week after week.</p><p>Answering what you are passionate about isn’t enough to form your niche around, but it is definitely a critical part. <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/how-to-find-your-passion.html" >Start by finding your passion. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Think of the things that you can do for hours without getting bored. Think of the hobbies you have where you put in hours and hours to improve. Think about all the research you’ve done on a given topic for no other reason than satisfying your own curiosity. These can all help you understand what you are most passionate about.</p><p>Knowing your passion opens an avenue for you to travel down in discovering your niche. But the journey isn’t over yet… there are few more questions to ask:</p><h4 id="What-Are-Your-Expertises"><a href="#What-Are-Your-Expertises" class="headerlink" title="What Are Your Expertises?"></a><strong>What Are Your Expertises?</strong></h4><p>Over the course of your life, you have gained experiences and skills — and you might not even know it. Stop for a moment and take inventory of everything that you feel you know better than the average person.</p><p>While the term “expert” is subjective, consider this, what can you pick up and do without a guide or a manual, or what can you tell me without Googling or researching?</p><p>If you can sit at a piano and start playing beautiful music, you have expertise in it. If you can tell me off the top of your head what train and bus to take to get across town, you are an expert in your city. Your expertise is what you confidently know.</p><h4 id="What-Do-People-Know-You-For"><a href="#What-Do-People-Know-You-For" class="headerlink" title="What Do People Know You For?"></a><strong>What Do People Know You For?</strong></h4><p>If you are having trouble finding your expertise, ask those who are close to you: What am I best known for?</p><p>If your friends tell you that you are known for being athletic, then that might be an area to explore. If your classmates tell you that you are always punctual, you might be an expert in time management.</p><p>Sometimes it takes someone else to tell you what your strengths and weaknesses are.</p><p>Once you’ve recognized what you are an expert on, you can expand on it.</p><p>Ask yourself these questions about your expertise:</p><p>- Can I teach people what I know?</p><p>- Will I want to learn more about this topic?</p><p>- Does this knowledge solve problems or improve life?</p><p>Once answered, you are that much closer to identifying your niche. But there is still another major question:</p><h4 id="What-Are-Your-Audience’s-Wants-and-Needs"><a href="#What-Are-Your-Audience’s-Wants-and-Needs" class="headerlink" title="What Are Your Audience’s Wants and Needs?"></a><strong>What Are Your Audience’s Wants and Needs?</strong></h4><p>If you are passionate about and an expert on a topic, but the topic is not interesting or useful to anyone then you are going to have a tough time getting views on YouTube.</p><p>When it comes down to it, your content needs to do at least 1 of 3 things, but if you strive to have all 3, you’ll have the recipe for a successful video:</p><p>- Educate</p><p>- Entertain</p><p>- Inspire</p><h4 id="Educate-Your-Audience"><a href="#Educate-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Educate Your Audience"></a><strong>Educate Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience wants to learn how to solve a problem or answer a question. If your content can teach, it will be valuable because it has real-world applications. (example: How-tos, product reviews, etc.)</p><h4 id="Entertain-Your-Audience"><a href="#Entertain-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Entertain Your Audience"></a><strong>Entertain Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience wants to be entertained. Remember, when a viewer is watching your content, they are choosing it over all the books, movies, and music in the world. You have their attention, so don’t be boring. (example: Daily vlogs, commentary, etc.)</p><h4 id="Inspire-Your-Audience"><a href="#Inspire-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Inspire Your Audience"></a><strong>Inspire Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience might be looking for a community to support them as they attempt a new goal. YouTube is a great platform to encourage others to do their best and achieve more. (example: 30-day challenges, motivational talks, etc.)</p><p>Don’t pick a niche simply because of general interest in a topic. If your niche comes to you in a flash and you go: “That’s a good idea,” before you set up your YouTube channel and commit to this video project, sit down, do some research, write out a script, and actually film the initial video. Go through the process and know what you are getting into.</p><p>Once you have a niche, it’s all about coming up with ideas for your video.

It’s not a moral issue. It’s normal. It’s enjoyable. It’s just is.”</em> - Carrie Arnold.</p><p>It’s just binging, munching, and chewing, but why is the audience interested in watching other people who scarf plateful food? Doesn’t it sound crazy and strange? But, yes, at present, there are thousands of people who view the growing trend of Korean videos, “Mukbang.” Confused on what is this <strong>Mukbang video</strong> all about and why it is a most included subject on YouTube?

However, the <strong>YouTube view monetization programs are</strong> not that clear. Most people don’t even know how YouTube monetization views work. How many views on YouTube do you need to start making money from your content on the platform? Some people have even been made to believe the common misconception that views alone determine the amount of money a YouTuber earns. Let’s have a look at what entails views for YouTube monetization and the factors that affect your earnings on the platform.</p><p><strong>YouTube Channel Grower</strong> A cross-platform for enhancing and editing YouTube videos for more engagement!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money"></a><strong>Part 1. The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money</strong></h2><p>Despite a lot of people seeking a successful career on YouTube, only a handful make it big on the platform. Some of the big names like Mr. Beast have proven how lucrative YouTube can be with the right following. However, for newcomers or beginners, succeeding on YouTube is a challenging feat.</p><p>The most burning question is how many monetized views on YouTube do you need to make money? A great deal of creators are still aiming to monetize YouTube views. Let’s have a look at what YouTube monetization review time involves and the views that get paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-1.JPG"                      alt="how many views to earn on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization"><a href="#Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization"></a><strong>Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization</strong></h3><p>Ideally, you will start earning ad revenue on YouTube for every 100 views on your videos. This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View"></a><strong>Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View</strong></h2><p>The amount of money that YouTubers make may seem complex to understand. Does YouTube pay per view? Yes, but not per video view. YouTube will pay you for views that appear on your channels. The actual revenue will depend on several factors.</p><ul><li><a href="#factor1">Factors Affecting Earnings per View</a></li><li><a href="#factor2">YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</a></li><li><a href="#factor3">Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</a></li><li><a href="#factor4">Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</a></li></ul><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting Earnings per View"></a><strong>Factors Affecting Earnings per View</strong></h3><p>The amount of money YouTubers make per view is affected by various factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Ad Revenue Rates</strong>: The rates vary depending on the country where viewers are located, the time of the year, and the ad your YouTube channel is running.</li><li><strong>Audience Demographics</strong>: Advertisers usually pay more to show their ads to viewers in some demographics, especially those who are interested in specific products or have a high income.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement</strong>: Videos with high CTR and AVD earn more income from ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time</strong>: YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time earn more money.</li></ul><h3 id="YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model"><a href="#YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model" class="headerlink" title="YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model"></a><strong>YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</strong></h3><p>The YouTibe’s revenue-sharing model determines how much creators are paid. The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers. This is because viewers will be engaged for longer periods, increasing their chances of viewing the ad.</li></ul><h3 id="Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube"><a href="#Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Other Revenue Streams on YouTube"></a><strong>Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</strong></h3><p>You can earn a lot more per 1,000 views by influencing your viewers to buy products even before your channel gets monetized. Other ways of making money on YouTube include</p><ul><li>Selling branded merch or courses</li><li>YouTube Premium subscriber’s subscription fee</li><li>Recurring monthly payments by members for special benefits</li><li>Highlight fan’s messages in chat streams</li><li>Sponsorships by partnering with brands to promote their products or services</li><li>Affiliate marketing</li><li>Brand deals</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Editing-YouTube-Videos-for-YouTube-Monetization-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Editing-YouTube-Videos-for-YouTube-Monetization-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. **Editing YouTube Videos for YouTube Monetization with Filmora"></a><strong>Part 3.</strong> **Editing YouTube Videos for YouTube Monetization with Filmora</h2><p>Good content will increase audience engagement and grow your YouTube channel.

Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.</p><p>Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.</p><p>All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%.

This part will give you 6 tips on creating thumbnails that help grow your channel. Now let’s learn how to make thumbnails using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Stay-On-Topic"><a href="#1-Stay-On-Topic" class="headerlink" title="1. Stay On Topic"></a>1. Stay On Topic</h4><p>Your thumbnail should tell a story; it should be clear from looking at it what viewers will get out of watching the video, be it knowledge or entertainment. If your thumbnail sets expectations that your video doesn’t deliver on, people will click away quickly. You may get views quickly, but you won’t get much watch time. That will tell YouTube’s search algorithm ‘people aren’t getting what they want from this, rank it lower’. That leads to fewer views over time, and gives the people who do manage to find your video a negative opinion of your channel.</p><p>Very few people intentionally use thumbnails that have nothing to do with the content of their videos – i.e, most people understand not to use a picture of a kitten in the thumbnail for their tech review, unless maybe their kitten is the one doing the review (which would be adorable, someone should do that). People who want serious advice won’t click, and people who click to see a kitten will click away fast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-should-stay-on-topic.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail Should be relevant"                ></p><p><em>This thumbnail had better be for a kitten’s iPhone review video or people will click away. Fast.</em></p><p>A mistake a lot of creators do make is creating a thumbnail that is meant to evoke an emotion which the video itself does not justify. For example, if you see a picture of a YouTuber looking nervous alongside text that reads ‘My Secret’, you will think they are going to share something deeply personal. You will be curious, and you may even be worried about them. You’ll probably click. Then, if their secret is that they don’t like pineapple on pizza, you’ll probably be angry. This technique gets clicks, but not a lot of watch time and it will lose you subs in the long run.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious"><a href="#2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Be Mysterious"></a>2. Don’t Be Mysterious</h4><p>A good thumbnail doesn’t make people guess. Your thumbnail should tell people what’s in your video, not make them wonder about it. People want to know what they’re being asked to spend time watching.</p><p>Often, they will be looking for the answer to a specific question and will completely ignore anything that doesn’t show – in the thumbnail – that it has their answer.</p><p>Sometimes big channels can get away with stuff like this, because large portions of their audiences are interested in them as people and will already be curious about anything they post. This technique will not bring in new viewers, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-tips-2.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail:  Don’t Be Mysterious"                ></p><p><em>If this came up in a search for ‘smoky eye tutorial’, would you click it?</em></p><p>When people want answers, they want to feel confident that they video they click on will have those answers. If you have great content, then let people know it!</p><h4 id="3-People-Like-People"><a href="#3-People-Like-People" class="headerlink" title="3. People Like People"></a>3. People Like People</h4><p>Viewers are more likely to click on a thumbnail if they feel a connection when they look at it. One of the best ways to create a feeling of connection is through eye contact, and you can apply that principle to your YouTube thumbnails easily.</p><p>Just make sure you’re in them.</p><p>You can either compose a photo to use as your thumbnail, or use a screenshot from your video. Ideally, the image of you will convey the emotional tone of the video and tell potential viewers what it is about, besides you.</p><p>So, if you want to post a funny video that is also about making brownies, maybe a picture of you smiling while holding up a tray of brownies would be a better direction than just showing the brownies?</p><h4 id="4-Check-Out-The-Competition"><a href="#4-Check-Out-The-Competition" class="headerlink" title="4. Check Out The Competition"></a>4. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Before you post your video, type your topic into YouTube’s search engine and see what comes up. This will give you insight into what kinds of thumbnails are performing well for other people, as well as what you can do to stand out in comparison.</p><p><em>Phil starts talking about thumbnails at 6:09, and he has great tips on checking out your competition!</em></p><p>For example, if all five of the top-ranked videos for the search ‘how to build a cabinet’ show images of the YouTuber smiling while holding a power tool, then your thumbnail for a video on the same topic should also be a picture of you smiling and holding a power tool. You know that works, so why not do it?</p><h4 id="5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways"><a href="#5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Color in Interesting Ways"></a>5. Use Color in Interesting Ways</h4><p>You want to use colors that will help you stand out from the other search results. While checking out your competition if you notice that all the people in the other thumbnails are wearing black or navy blue, it will be a good idea for you to wear a brighter color for your shoot to grab a bit more attention.</p><p>Beyond simply using colors that are different from other people’s colors, you should consider the emotions different colors trigger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-use-color.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail Making Tips"                ></p><p><em>Maybe don’t use a lot of green and yellow in the thumbnail for your angry video rant?</em></p><h4 id="6-Make-Your-Text-Huge"><a href="#6-Make-Your-Text-Huge" class="headerlink" title="6. Make Your Text Huge"></a>6. Make Your Text Huge</h4><p>Usually, you’ll want to use a bit of text in your thumbnail. It might be the full title of your video, or just a keyword or phrase. You don’t want to use a full sentence because you won’t have room for it if you’re using huge text.</p><p>The reason you should use huge text is so that people can read it. Remember that when people see your thumbnail in their search results, it will be much smaller than it will look while you are creating it. Text that looks big enough while you are creating your thumbnail will be much smaller when people are actually trying to read it, and that goes double for viewers watching on their small smartphone screens.</p><h3 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Thumbnail</h3><h4 id="1-What-is-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#1-What-is-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="1.

This might be needed if you have uploaded content quite some time ago and it is already outdated. Or, if you have too many videos on your channel and you need to clear up those who aren’t that interesting.</p><p> The fact of the matter is that it’s quite easy to remove YouTube videos. The first thing that you would need to do is going ahead and hop on the website and log into your account. Afterwards, you need to go to the “My Channel” option and click on the “Video Manager”.</p><p> Upon doing this, a new page is going to pop up, and you are going to see a list of all the videos that you’ve uploaded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-youtube-video-basic-description-3.jpg"                      alt="Video list"                ></p><p> There are little tick boxes on the left side which you can click in order to mark. Mark the videos that you want to edit and click on the “Actions” button on top. There is going to be a drop-down menu, and you can click on the delete option to remove the video permanently. Furthermore, you can also hide the video if you don’t want to delete it but only to hide it away from your subscribers. In order to do so, you should simply click on the Private or Unlisted button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/how-to-remove-youtube-videos.jpg"                      alt="remove youtube videos"                ></p><p> That’s pretty much it – there’s nothing further to it, and the entire thing is rather comprehensive and easy to carry out, which makes it convenient to go through.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-on-Other-Channels"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-on-Other-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels"></a>Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels</h2><p> Now that we’ve covered how to remove videos from your own channel, it’s time to dig a little bit deeper. There are certain instances in which you might want to remove YouTube videos from other channels as well. The reasons for this are usually rather personal. For instance – someone has uploaded a video including you or something yours without your consent, and this harms your reputation. Furthermore, it may display sensitive information that you don’t want to reveal to anyone else – the reasons are rather different, but they are related to your own individual privacy which is an important legal right.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Blur Faces in YouTube Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The first thing you can do is contact the person who uploaded the video and kindly asks him to remove it using the procedure that we described above. This is going to be the best choice because it’s going to achieve the result quickly and without any hassle. However, in certain cases, the person might not be active, or he might disagree with you and keep the video posted. If that’s the case, you have one option which is likely to be the best alternative.</p><p> You need to report the video as an inappropriate and flag it with the remark that it’s invading your privacy. This is going to lead you to the page of the YouTube Safety Center. You will have to explain the issue in details in a six-step wizard which extensively asks you about how the video is invasive to your privacy rights. The process is quite comprehensive, and it’s easy to go through. However, you will have to wait for the YouTube support team to assess it and make the decision for the removal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-youtube-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="remove other&#39;s youtube videos"                ></p><p> The truth is that being able to remove YouTube videos is something important that you should be able to do.

The pandemic has accelerated its growth. But what made it so special? Watching live streams is different from watching regular videos.

YouTube uses these keywords to determine the subject of your video, index the content, and then associate it with what users are searching for. As such, you must add them to certain fields, including description, tags, and title, when you are uploading the video file. YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.</p><p>For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title"><a href="#2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="2.

Given how important it is, you’ll want to make sure that your title accurately reflects the content of your video and includes all relevant keywords.</p><h4 id="3-Link-Your-Videos-Directly-to-Your-Website"><a href="#3-Link-Your-Videos-Directly-to-Your-Website" class="headerlink" title="3. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website"></a>3. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website</h4><p>Each time you publish a new video, make sure you embed it on your website or blog. Not only will this encourage viewers to stay on your website instead of leaving immediately, but it will also make it easier for search engines crawlers to index your website.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Tags-To-The-Video-Description"><a href="#4-Add-Tags-To-The-Video-Description" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can do this by adding some relevant keywords with each tag like you would with blog posts.</p><p>When planning your strategy for YouTube keywords, you need to find 10-20 single keyword tags you want to rank for; keep in mind that this platform limits the number of tags users can include in a video. So you should first add the most relevant keyword phrases then include specific multi-word tags that will easily rank on top of search results.</p><h4 id="5-Edit-The-Filename"><a href="#5-Edit-The-Filename" class="headerlink" title="5.

Including keywords in this section will help the crawlers index your video faster, which will increase its chances of ranking higher.</p><h4 id="6-Add-Subtitles-and-Closed-Captions"><a href="#6-Add-Subtitles-and-Closed-Captions" class="headerlink" title="6.

Subtitles make it easier for new viewers to understand your videos, especially if your audience comes from different linguistic backgrounds.</p><h4 id="7-Select-Video-Category"><a href="#7-Select-Video-Category" class="headerlink" title="7. Select Video Category"></a>7. Select Video Category</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-6.png"                      alt="youtube seo tips - select video category"                ></p><p>When uploading a video, be sure to select the most appropriate category for it. Essentially, this helps with SEO optimization because choosing the right category means that YouTube’s algorithm will place your video in the proper search results. In turn, viewers will easily find your video and watch it.</p><h4 id="8-Use-a-Compelling-Thumbnail"><a href="#8-Use-a-Compelling-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="8.

You might want to use high-quality, high-contrast images with a 16:9 aspect ratio. YouTube will choose which frame it will display as the video thumbnail. The platform will present three screenshots that you can choose from; however, you can upload your image or select a shot of another moment in the video.</p><p>Remember that YouTube overlays the duration of the video in the corner of your thumbnail. So make sure it does not obstruct any relevant details in your thumbnail. Google also uses image recognition to filter out specific imagery, including the YouTube logo.</p><p>Ideally, you need an image that is a perfect visual representation of the keywords you are targeting. In turn, this is going to take your presence in relevant search results even further.</p><h4 id="9-Make-High-Quality-Longer"><a href="#9-Make-High-Quality-Longer" class="headerlink" title="9. Make High-Quality Longer"></a>9. Make High-Quality Longer</h4><p>Videos that are less than 2 minutes long often rank low. The duration of most of the videos in the first five positions is usually 11 minutes 44 seconds. Therefore, you need to invest in longer videos that are around 10 minutes long. These videos meet the expectations of many users seeking complete and in-depth content. Additionally, you should create high-quality videos to ensure your viewers will keep watching.</p><h4 id="Create-High-Quality-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Create-High-Quality-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Create High-Quality YouTube Video with Filmora"></a>Create High-Quality YouTube Video with Filmora</h4><p>Wondershare’s Filmora program allows you to edit your video content with trim, transitions, and overlays.
