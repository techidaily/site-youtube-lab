Your pinned comment will appear at the top of the comment list, whereby everyone who has watched the video can’t miss coming across it. It is good, to be honest, and asking for them to subscribe is the best you can do after an engaging video shot.</p><h4 id="8-Add-value-to-other-channels-3"><a href="#8-Add-value-to-other-channels-3" class="headerlink" title="8) Add value to other channels"></a>8) Add value to other channels</h4><p>Don’t be selfish and want users to subscribe to your channel for nothing. Try to engage also in other people’s works and efforts. You can watch content that appeals to you and engage the community by creating a conversation. Find out what others like, and you might just attract a new subscriber to your channel so simply.</p><h4 id="9-Let-your-homepage-be-intuitive-3"><a href="#9-Let-your-homepage-be-intuitive-3" class="headerlink" title="9) Let your homepage be intuitive"></a>9) Let your homepage be intuitive</h4><p>Your homepage should be welcoming to both the tech gurus and beginners. Not all YouTube users have mastered the art of navigation on web pages or clicks. It is a good idea to use a channel trailer and a better description of what your channel does and how to reach important buttons. The homepage should not be crowded. You can use links to reach other pages as well.</p><h4 id="10-Be-innovative-3"><a href="#10-Be-innovative-3" class="headerlink" title="10) Be innovative"></a>10) Be innovative</h4><p>Your video is your voice. You should create a video that attracts your audience by doing it right. Perhaps you don’t know how to come up with a compelling piece.

Are Good For Travel Vlogging</p><p>Every travel vlogger should have a <strong>wide-angle lens</strong>. Wide-angle lenses fit much more of a scene into your camera frame, making it ideal for capturing establishing shots. You’ll also need a wide-angle lens if you plan on holding your camera out in front of yourself with an extended arm to get selfie footage.</p><p>As a travel vlogger, you’ll also want to show some close-up shots of the various subjects in your scene. If you don’t mind walking up to these subjects, the lens I recommend for this is a <strong>standard lens</strong>.</p><p>If, however, you want to be able to shoot these close-up shots from a farther distance, you’ll need a <strong>telephoto lens</strong>.</p><p>But you probably don’t want to carry and switch so many lenses as you travel, right? A convenient solution is to get a zoom lens that covers a wide range of focal lengths. For example, travel vlogger Sam Kolder shoots with a Canon EF 24-105mm f&#x2F;4 lens – that’s a wide-angle lens, standard lens, and telephoto lens all in one lens!</p><p>If most of your travel video shooting will be done handheld, you should also definitely look for a lens equipped with <strong>optical image stabilization</strong>.</p><p>Check out my <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Camera Lens for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to gain a more in-depth understanding of lenses and how they work.</p><h3 id="1-2-Travel-Vlogging-Accessories"><a href="#1-2-Travel-Vlogging-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Travel Vlogging Accessories"></a>1.2 Travel Vlogging Accessories</h3><p><strong>Camera Accessories That Are Good For Travel Vlogging</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tripod1.jpg"                      alt="Travel Tripod"                ></th><th><strong>1.

Travel Vlog</strong></p><p>Travel vlogging, the kind where you film yourself just going about your day in a different part of the world, is a great way to not only document your travel moments and memories for yourself, but also a great way to share your experience with others.</p><p>Rather than being too picky with your video shots and possibly ending up with a lack of footage to work with, shoot as much as you can.</p><p>Try to capture your thoughts and feelings around the things you taste, smell, see and hear. Sharing these details can help your viewers feel more like they’re with you on your travels.</p><p> <strong>2. Tips or Tricks for Traveling</strong></p><p>Although learning from mistakes during your travels can be a rewarding experience, most people want to avoid them and, rather, enjoy their trip as much as they possibly can. After all, travel, for most people, happens in intervals that seem too short. You can help this sizable group by offering travel tips and tricks.</p><p>Prepare a list of tips and tricks, a shot list of all the footage you’ll need to go along with those tips, and then capture all your footage. As you go through your list, you can then cut away to your associated travel shots.</p><p> <strong>3. Video Tour of a Location</strong></p><p>Many people are curious about different parts of the world and would love to join a tour without the high cost of flights, hotels, meals, and admission tickets. Give them that experience by making a video tour.</p><p> <strong>4. Review An Attraction or Experience</strong></p><p>A lot of travelers having a limited amount of time and money to enjoy their chosen travel destinations want to know which attractions and experiences to prioritize and which ones to skip. Help them make their decision by making a video review.</p><p> <strong>5. Timelapse Videos</strong></p><p>All you need in addition to your camera is a tripod to get started with making timelapse videos. Your tripod stabilizes your shot as your camera captures all the changes that take place in a given location.</p><p>When your footage is sped up, your viewers can appreciate all the changes that take place that they may not have had the patience to sit through in real-time. It’s also interesting to observe the passage of time in a different way.</p><p> <strong>6. Average Daily Cost</strong></p><p>Before going on a trip, many people try to make a budget and figure out how much money to exchange into foreign currency. Making a good budget and getting just enough foreign cash, though, requires you to know how much, on average, things cost.</p><p>Make a helpful video on the average cost of daily expenses including meals and transportation like Paolo did in the above video “Average Daily Cost in Tokyo Japan | Is it Expensive?.” His video actually helped me a lot when I was trying to come up with a budget for my recent trip to Japan.</p><p> <strong>7. Interview Locals</strong></p><p>People don’t travel only to see popular attractions. A lot of people travel to connect with and understand people from different parts of the world.</p><p>Interviewing locals and sharing their thoughts can help to provide that kind of connection.</p><p> <strong>8. What’s in My Backpack?</strong></p><p>Packing for a trip can say a lot about who you are as a person because it involves prioritizing items based on your personal values.</p><p>For your next trip, share a little part of yourself with your audience through a video about the things you’ve packed in your bag.</p><p> <strong>9. Talk About Your Own Home City</strong></p><p>When you’ve lived in your own home city for so long, you might forget that people all over the world may marvel at the things you take for granted because all those things just happen to be at your doorstep.</p><p>Take advantage of the expert that you already are in your own home city and make an informative video for others who are taking a trip there.</p><p> <strong>10.

Otherwise, keep your SLR camera concealed.</li><li>Never leave your equipment unattended in a visible area, not even in a locked car.</li></ul><p> <strong>Pre-Production and Planning</strong></p><ul><li>Before shooting, make a shot list of all the footage you need.</li><li>Have all your filming equipment that needs to be calibrated all calibrated and ready to use.</li></ul><p> <strong>Onscreen Performance</strong></p><ul><li>Look into your lens, not the projected image of yourself on your camera’s flip screen.</li><li>Show a lot of energy as you film yourself.</li><li>If you’re nervous about talking to the camera in public, keep your talking head clips short and gradually build your way up to longer clips. You can break up longer sentences by saying a few words from one scene, saying a few more in another, and finishing off your last words, again, in another scene. Later, in editing, you can stitch all of those clips together to make one fluid sentence.</li><li>If you’re nervous about talking to the camera in public, you can capture your talking headshots later when you find a more secluded space.</li></ul><p> <strong>Audio Recording</strong></p><ul><li>Silence everything you don’t want your mic to record.</li><li>Put your mobile phone in airplane mode.</li><li>Block wind from reaching your mic with windscreens and dead cats.</li><li>Upgrade your mic.</li><li>Adjust your levels.</li><li>Get close to the sound you are wanting to record.</li></ul><p>Check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/10-recording-tips-to-get-the-best-sound-from-your-390.html" >10 Recording Tips to Get The Best Sound From Your Microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more audio recording tips.</p><p> <strong>Filming</strong></p><ul><li>To avoid crowds, wake up early and grab your footage early while everyone else is still sleeping or getting ready.</li><li>Capture wide shots, medium shots, and close-up shots for better coverage.</li><li>Use the Sun Seeker app to set up your sunrise&#x2F;sunset shots better.</li><li>If your camera can record 4K footage, record in 4K all the scenes that you want to zoom in closer later in editing without losing quality (your video project in editing has to be at 1920p x 1080p for this to work).</li></ul><p> <strong>Stabilization</strong></p><ul><li>If you’re trying to get shots with movement by walking, rather than walking as you normally would walk with your knees bent for steadier shots.</li><li>If you’re shooting something in front of your handheld, lean your arm against your own body for steadier shots.</li><li>Use a stabilizing gimbal with your camera.</li></ul><p> <strong>Timelapse&#x2F;Hyperlapse</strong></p><ul><li>Select scenes where you can see a lot of change over time (not a still building in front of a cloudless smoggy sky).</li><li>Set longer intervals for scenes that change very slowly over time.</li><li>Pre-set your focus. Turn autofocus off.</li><li>Shoot time-lapses&#x2F;hyper-lapses in manual mode to prevent the flickering that occurs with changing light conditions in automatic settings.</li><li>If your camera is set on a tripod in a fixed position, turn your optical image stabilization off.</li><li>If you aren’t holding onto your camera as it’s in the middle of making a timelapse video, at least keep your camera and tripod attached by some kind of leash mechanism.</li><li>For moving time-lapses or hyper-lapses, try to keep one point of reference in the same position within your camera frame.</li></ul><p> <strong>Slow Motion</strong></p><ul><li>Shoot slow-motion videos when there is plenty of light.</li><li>For actions that are as slow as walking, slowing down your footage to 50% of the original speed looks good enough. If your video editing project is in 30 fps, shooting your video in 60 fps will give you a 50% slow-motion video. If your video editing project is in 60 fps, shooting your video in 120 fps will give you a 50% slow-motion video. Any slower is overkill for slowing down the speed of walking.</li><li>For actions that are as fast as water splashing, slowing down your footage as little as 15% of the original speed can look good. For a video editing project in 30 fps, you would need a camera that can shoot at up to 240 fps to slow your footage down this much.</li></ul><p> <strong>Storage and Back-Up</strong></p><ul><li>If you’re using a phone that can store images and videos on a separate SD card, take advantage of that and record your travel footage onto your SD card. Later, you can easily get to your travel media as it will all be in one place.</li><li>If you have your laptop on you, regularly transfer your media files from your cameras to your external hard drives.</li><li>If you don’t want to bring your laptop on your trip and plan to video edit once you’re back home, use a USB memory card reader that connects with an app on your phone to transfer your files into your external hard drive.</li><li>If you have access to a reliable internet connection and you leave your laptop at your place of accommodation, have your computer upload your files onto cloud storage while you are out to travel vlogging.</li><li>Take advantage of Google Photos’ free, unlimited cloud storage for video files up to 1080p.</li></ul><p> <strong>Video Editing</strong></p><ul><li>If you’re editing a video project with videos from multiple different cameras, make sure to set the correct time and date on all of them before you start filming. Later, in editing, you can import all your image and video files and sort them in the exact order that they were taken.</li><li>If your video editing software can work with proxies, transcode all your video files into proxy files for much faster editing.</li></ul><p> <strong>Posting On YouTube</strong></p><ul><li>Choose a title that people will search for. Keep your target keywords at the beginning of your title. “S01E01: My Summer Backpacking Trip” is not an effective title. Instead, a title like “Going Up The Eiffel Tower… Beautiful View of Paris!” would be better.</li></ul><h2 id="Ready-to-Become-a-Travel-Vlogger"><a href="#Ready-to-Become-a-Travel-Vlogger" class="headerlink" title="Ready to Become a Travel Vlogger?"></a>Ready to Become a Travel Vlogger?</h2><p>Here in this article, I shared travel vlogging cameras &amp;accessories, travel video ideas&amp; resources, and travel vlogging tips.

There is some truth to this. When you have a higher number of subscribers it is easier to get even more. That is why some users try to use methods like Sub4Sub to improve their numbers.</p><p> Sub4Sub, or ‘sub for sub’, is the practice of subscribing to somebody else’s channel in exchange for them subscribing to yours. Whether Sub4Sub works is debatable, but it is fairly popular. YouTubers often send messages to other YouTubers asking if they would like to sub for sub, and there are even off-YouTube sites devoted to connecting YouTubers so they can subscribe to each other. A lot of vloggers do not believe in Sub4Sub, though. This is because they doubt whether subscribers gained this way actually help them get more views on their videos.</p><p> This article will explain the pros and cons of Sub4Sub.</p><h2 id="Does-YouTube-Sub4Sub-Work"><a href="#Does-YouTube-Sub4Sub-Work" class="headerlink" title="Does YouTube Sub4Sub Work"></a>Does YouTube Sub4Sub Work</h2><h4 id="1-Does-Sub4Sub-Work"><a href="#1-Does-Sub4Sub-Work" class="headerlink" title="1. Does Sub4Sub Work?"></a>1. Does Sub4Sub Work?</h4><p> The technical answer is ‘yes’. You can get new subscribers quickly using sub for sub and it is in no way against YouTube’s rules. On the other hand, subscribers gained through sub for sub do not watch or share your videos. Users end up with more subscribers, but their channels do not truly grow.</p><h4 id="2-Pros-of-Sub4Sub"><a href="#2-Pros-of-Sub4Sub" class="headerlink" title="2. Pros of Sub4Sub"></a>2. Pros of Sub4Sub</h4><p> A big part of doing well on YouTube is being engaged in your vlogging community. If a YouTuber with a similar topic to yours approaches you with a Sub4Sub request and you engage them in a conversation it could be the beginning of a great friendship. Beyond subscribing to each other you can share tips, comment on each other’s videos, and maybe even collaborate on a video someday.</p><p> Sub4Sub can also help some YouTubers with their confidence. It can be discouraging not to see any growth and being embarrassed over their low subscriber counts can result in vloggers deciding to hide that information. They may feel like their content is being judged badly by people who are not even watching their videos based on how few subscribers they have. Building up a higher number using Sub4Sub may allow some YouTubers to move past these concerns and get back to focusing on making good videos.</p><h4 id="3-Cons-of-Sub4Sub"><a href="#3-Cons-of-Sub4Sub" class="headerlink" title="3. Cons of Sub4Sub"></a>3. Cons of Sub4Sub</h4><p> The reality is that if people are pre-judging your videos based on your stats it is not subscribers they are looking at so much as views. Sub4Sub helps you get subscribers, but in most cases those subscribers will never watch any of your videos. They will also never share them or tell their friends to watch them, the way subscribers gained organically will. So while your subscriber count goes up, your view count stays low.</p><p> The situation described in the Pros section, where you talk to each other and comment on each other’s videos, is rare. You are more likely to make friends with other YouTubers after you have already watched each other’s videos or after chatting in a forum. It is worth trying to engage a vlogger with a similar topic to yours if they ask you to sub for sub, but most people who ask will have no intention of interacting with you beyond subscribing to each other. Realistically if you are going to use sub for sub to increase your subscriber count by any significant number you will not have time to have actual conversations with everyone you approach, or to watch their videos.</p><p> When you agree to exchange subscriptions with somebody there is also the danger that they will decide to unsubscribe from your channel afterwards. This could happen much later when they realize they do not want to be subscribed to so many people and have forgotten which channels were parts of Sub4Sub agreements. Or it could happen within weeks, days, or even hours of you subscribing to them. There are some dishonest YouTubers who use sub for sub to get subscribers while already planning to unsubscribe to anybody who agrees. Their hope is that the other person will not notice or will not bother unsubscribing from them if they do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-achieve-harmony-import-audio-to-your-inshot-clips/"><u>[New] Achieve Harmony Import Audio to Your InShot Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-cloaked-observer-of-facebook-snapshots/"><u>[New] Cloaked Observer of Facebook Snapshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-experience-the-future-of-action-videos-sj7s-star-4k-review-for-2024/"><u>[New] Experience the Future of Action Videos SJ7's Star 4K Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-decoding-the-essence-of-asmr-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Decoding the Essence of ASMR Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/n-2024-unified-youtube-behavior-manual/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unified YouTube Behavior Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/fixing-the-elusive-mfc42ddll-error-tips-and-tricks-for-a-smooth-solution/"><u>Fixing The Elusive mfc42d.dll Error: Tips and Tricks for a Smooth Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/improved-functionality-alert-download-the-new-driver-for-your-dell-2330d-or-2330dn-laser-printer-now/"><u>Improved Functionality Alert: Download the New Driver for Your Dell 2330D or 2330Dn Laser Printer Now!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-pro-rated-income-status-for-content-makers/"><u>In 2024, Pro-Rated Income Status for Content Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-tailored-for-tech-savvy-audiences-unveil-the-youtuber-who-resonates-with-you-through-six-quizzes/"><u>In 2024, Tailored for Tech-Savvy Audiences Unveil the YouTuber Who Resonates with You Through Six Quizzes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-unveiling-the-top-7-android-apps-to-banish-ads/"><u>In 2024, Unveiling The Top 7 Android Apps to Banish Ads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/innovative-and-striking-pfp-designs-for-standout-profiles/"><u>Innovative and Striking PFP Designs for Standout Profiles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/1721461929259-troubleshoot-non-functioning-predictive-emojis-on-ios-devices-asap/"><u>Troubleshoot Non-Functioning Predictive Emojis on iOS Devices ASAP</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2121334/18498" target="_top" id="2121334">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2121334" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2121334/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

It has supplied so much information that it took this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >comprehensive post about Analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to highlight all the insights. So why would YouTube change it?</p><p>Change to a popular social media platform is always worrisome to content creators because it means there will be a new learning phase forced upon them. While the Classic YouTube Creator Studio has a lot of features and functionality, the data was often hard to interpret and inconvenient to find. Many creators weren’t sure where their data was located or how to use the information presented to them.</p><p>YouTube Studio was designed to be a friendly management and analysis tool. YouTube also offers more guidance, showcasing the key metrics the algorithm uses to evaluate the success of a video more prominently. Additionally, the graphs presented offer more clarity, shortening the time a creator spends finding the information they need.</p><p>Undoubtedly, YouTube updated its Creator Studio to offer a tool that enables its users to better understand their video performance and make better content that serves YouTube’s requirements.</p><h2 id="Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta"><a href="#Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta" class="headerlink" title="Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)"></a>Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Studio Beta"                ></p><p>YouTube Studio (Beta), for many YouTubers, is now the default. However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2. Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos. This data can be used to compare the size of your subscriber base to the actual number of your audience.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features"></a>Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features</h2><p>Now that you are more familiar with the new YouTube Studio (Beta), let us dive into what you can accomplish with all the new features.</p><h4 id="1-Optimization-Tips"><a href="#1-Optimization-Tips" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimization Tips"></a>1. Optimization Tips</h4><p>In the past, there has been a lot of speculations about how creators should treat their video titles and descriptions. Well, now YouTube is letting you know exactly which area to focus on. Simply hover over any “?” icon to see the advice and click “Learn More” to go to YouTube Creator Academy to get more details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-optimization.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Beta Optimization Tips"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139117/17108" target="_top" id="2139117">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139117" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139117/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="2-Recent-Video-Data"><a href="#2-Recent-Video-Data" class="headerlink" title="2. Recent Video Data"></a>2. Recent Video Data</h4><p>See data and improvement tips for your latest video. If YouTube identifies a notable issue with your video, they will help you by offering tips, which you can click “Tell Me More” to look into.</p><p>YouTube wants you to know how your videos are performing in the first few days. In order for YouTube to determine whether your content is worth sharing, it wants to know how your audience is responding to it right away. This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Analysis"></a>3. Video Analysis</h4><p>In the Classic Creator Studio, you couldn’t get an aggregated view of all the important video data on one dashboard. You would have to click to each set of analytics individually and then dive deeper. This ate up your precious content creation time and made it hard to combine insights. Now with Studio Beta, you can see all the critical data in one spot. Right away, you can see how that video is performing through different factors. This will let you know where audience retention is dropping off or which traffic source is supplying most of the views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-video-analysis.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="4-Watch-Time-Funnel"><a href="#4-Watch-Time-Funnel" class="headerlink" title="4. Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic. However, 60-70% is a great number to aim towards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-watch-time-funnel.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio Watch Time Funnel"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137207/26400" target="_top" id="2137207">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137207" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137207/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="5-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#5-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="5. Traffic Sources"></a>5. Traffic Sources</h4><p>YouTube now presents all the different traffic sources in one easy-to-find page in the Reach Viewer tab, so creators no longer have to click between them to analyze where their traffic is coming from. This new design is far less intimidating and messy. At a glance, you can now see where the majority of your audiences are coming from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-traffic-source.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Traffic Source"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115944/19272" target="_top" id="2115944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115944/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>YouTube has always put a lot of value into its analytic tools, and with YouTube Studio Beta the features and design are continuously improving.

Don’t hesitate to tell your viewers about these goals – if they think your content is of real value, chances are they will be only too happy to assist you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-goals.JPG"                      alt="goals"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135364/19272" target="_top" id="2135364">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135364" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135364/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Contests-can-be-funny-–-why-not-enter-one"><a href="#2-Contests-can-be-funny-–-why-not-enter-one" class="headerlink" title="2.

A site called Gleam can oversee a contest for you. It’s up to you to choose how you want the contest to work, and you can gain an edge over your competitors by getting people to leave comments, follow you on Instagram, subscribe to your channel and more.</p><p>You will be provided with a landing page for promoting your channel, and you can share this in a variety of places, including on your Facebook, Twitter and blog. The best way to heighten your chances of success is to have a clear goal in mind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-contest.JPG"                      alt="video0 contest"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137379/7443" target="_top" id="2137379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Make-a-trailer"><a href="#3-Make-a-trailer" class="headerlink" title="3.

Your trailer gives you a valuable opportunity to quickly explain what your channel is all about and what the benefits of following you are.</p><p>Don’t waffle on – try to get your clip down to 90 seconds maximum. Include clips from your videos and don’t forget to add a strong call to action at the end. The more effort you put into your videos, the bigger the rewards are likely to become.

It will also give your subscribers a chance to anticipate your videos and get excited. They are more likely to watch an update they have been expecting than one that was not already on their minds.</p><p>Sticking to your schedule is a good wait to build up credibility with your audience, but late or skipped updates will cause you to lose that credibility. If you do not post for a month then people who already subscribed to you might still ignore your update because it has been too long and they forgot about you.</p><h3 id="5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers"><a href="#5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="5.

When you collaborate with another vlogger you are essentially introducing each other to your subscribers. This is a great way to grow your community quickly: by connecting it to another community.</p><p>Collaborations work best when the other vlogger is located close enough to you that you can actually meet up, but you can do distance collaborations too. When you collaborate you and the other vlogger should have close to the same number of subscribers, so the video will benefit you both equally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cooperation.JPG"                      alt="cooperation"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/1995803/22899" target="_top" id="1995803">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-1995803" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/1995803/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Get-Free-YouTube-Subscribers-6-Proven-Methods"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Get-Free-YouTube-Subscribers-6-Proven-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers [6 Proven Methods]"></a>Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers [6 Proven Methods]</h2><p>There are lots of ways to get free YouTube subscribers. This proven method involves networking with other creators! Making your presence felt on YouTube is an important part of creating your network of subscribers that watch, share and talk about your videos. Interaction with your subscribers, reaching new audiences every day, and a plethora of other factors influence how well your YouTube channel is doing.</p><p>In this part, we will show you how you can build your own network of loyal YouTube supporters and prove that you don’t need the services of paid providers who promise better reach for your channel.</p><h3 id="1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche"><a href="#1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche" class="headerlink" title="1. Find YouTubers in your niche"></a>1. Find YouTubers in your niche</h3><p>The first step to building an enviable army of YouTube subscribers starts with the realization that you are not alone. Regardless of the niche, your videos are covering, there are probably thousands of people who are just starting out or that have as many subscribers as your YouTube channel. Focus on finding them. You may even want to make a list.</p><h3 id="2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like"><a href="#2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like" class="headerlink" title="2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like"></a>2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like</h3><p>Of the channels you found in Step 1, choose the ones you genuinely like and subscribe to them.</p><p>It goes without saying that everyone enjoys support, especially if you are not asking for anything in return. By subscribing to YouTube channels in your genre you appreciate, you will make yourself known to the channel’s owner, and there is a chance they will check out and subscribe to your channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135396/19272" target="_top" id="2135396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135396/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day"><a href="#3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day" class="headerlink" title="3. Spend time watching videos each day"></a>3. Spend time watching videos each day</h3><p>Knowledge is power and, if you want to attract real people to your channel, you should learn how to use your knowledge to your advantage. By paying attention to other new videos in your genre you’ll gain insight into what is going over well with audiences like yours, and what isn’t.</p><p>Also, be especially sure to watch videos from those channels you found in Step 1 and subscribed to in Step 2. Try to watch at least two minutes of content from those channels whenever they upload.</p><h3 id="4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return"><a href="#4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return" class="headerlink" title="4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return"></a>4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return</h3><p>Most YouTubers are delighted to hear someone else’s positive opinion or constructive criticism regarding their work. The reason you are watching 2 minutes of content per video in Step 3 is so that you will really have something to say in this step.</p><p>If you do make a thoughtful comment, and especially if you use the time stamp of the part of the video you’re referring to, the video creator will know you have watched the video and that you are not just another spammer. Avoid the sub-4-sub strategy, and don’t be the person who’s always saying ‘Subscribe to my channel’. You will be ignored by both the creator and other viewers, and the creator will find you annoying. However, if you comment regularly without asking for anything, the creator and some of their viewers will naturally decide to check out your channel.</p><h3 id="5-Reach-out-on-social-media"><a href="#5-Reach-out-on-social-media" class="headerlink" title="5. Reach out on social media"></a>5. Reach out on social media</h3><p>YouTube is just one out of many channels through which you can reach like-minded people. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or any other social network can help you network with other creators and potential subscribers. Create accounts on social networks you find the most suitable for your video category and share links to your videos on these accounts as often as you can. Furthermore, if you try to foster real discussions about topics that are relevant, people who get to know you through these other platforms will probably decide to check out your YouTube channel.</p><p>Social media is also a great place to reach out to other creators, whether it’s for collabs or just to chat about doing YouTube.</p><h3 id="6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again"><a href="#6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again" class="headerlink" title="6. Do it all again. And again. And again"></a>6. Do it all again. And again. And again</h3><p>You aren’t going to see great results overnight. You have to spend time almost every day repeating the steps we just described. This might seem intimidating, but as time passes it will become routine.</p><p>When you build your presence on YouTube in this way, other creators and their subscribers will naturally start becoming your subscribers. What’s your best tip for free YouTube subscribers?</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Some people might need to watch multiple videos by you before they decide they want to subscribe. If you stop making videos because you did not get any subscribers or comments on your first few then chances are there were people who were paying attention who may have subscribed if you had kept at it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-latest-vr-gaming-engines-review-2023-edition/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Latest VR Gaming Engines Review - 2023 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/est-choice-streamline-your-youtube-audio-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best Choice Streamline Your YouTube Audio for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ducational-history-vlogs-the-ultimate-list/"><u>[New] Educational History Vlogs - The Ultimate List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-podcastpivot-avoiding-dacasts-pitfalls/"><u>[New] PodcastPivot Avoiding DaCast's Pitfalls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/he-year-of-gaming-earnings-revolutions-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Year of Gaming Earnings Revolutions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ltimate-guide-to-the-best-10-video-saving-devices/"><u>[New] Ultimate Guide to the Best 10 Video Saving Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-conquer-mixer-broadcasting-on-macos-systems/"><u>[Updated] Conquer Mixer Broadcasting on macOS Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-effective-approach-to-swiftly-eliminate-video-comments/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Effective Approach to Swiftly Eliminate Video Comments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-taking-your-videos-to-the-next-level-expert-pc-methods-for-youtubers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Taking Your Videos to the Next Level Expert PC Methods for YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-sprinkle-life-into-text-two-methods-for-bouncing-effects-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Sprinkle Life Into Text Two Methods for Bouncing Effects for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-unleash-potential-with-these-essential-editing-tips-for-beginners/"><u>[Updated] Unleash Potential with These Essential Editing Tips for Beginners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-do-you-unlock-your-iphone-14-pro-learn-all-4-methods-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How Do You Unlock your iPhone 14 Pro?

They have two alternatives for customers who want to use their apps: either pay for such a lifetime purchase of the app or enjoy the free version that includes ADS. Best ad blocker for android helps eliminate ADS from apps installed on our Android devices.</p><p>Many people choose to use the free version since they can’t afford to pay for a standard app, while some opt for Mods, but the best method to avoid ADS is to use programs that block them entirely.

You should also keep an eye on the length and file size limits. The more basic things you need to consider carefully when you upload are the title, description, and tags of your video. These are part of what determines if and where your video comes up in people’s search results. There are also slightly more advanced video specs, like your video’s resolution, which will be helpful for you to understand as somebody who will be producing video content frequently. These sorts of specs will affect how long it takes your videos to upload and how much of the quality they maintain.</p><h4 id="1-How-Long-Can-my-Video-Be"><a href="#1-How-Long-Can-my-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="1.  How Long Can my Video Be?"></a>1.  How Long Can my Video Be?</h4><p>By default, your YouTube videos can only be 15 minutes long. You can post longer videos by going to the upload page and clicking on ‘Increase your Limit’ at the bottom. After you have followed the steps to verify your account you will be able to post videos that are a maximum of 11 hours long.</p><h4 id="2-How-Big-a-File-Can-I-Upload"><a href="#2-How-Big-a-File-Can-I-Upload" class="headerlink" title="2.  How Big a File Can I Upload?"></a>2.  How Big a File Can I Upload?</h4><p>Your file size was capped at 20GB, initially. If you follow the same steps for posting videos longer than 15 minutes then you can also increase your maximum file size to 128GB.</p><h4 id="3-Other-Basics"><a href="#3-Other-Basics" class="headerlink" title="3.  Other Basics"></a>3.  Other Basics</h4><p>After you click the ‘upload’ button on YouTube you are taken to a page where you choose a category for your video and add a title, description, and tags. These are all important for getting hits so you should put some thought into them.</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Keep your title under 70 characters so none of it disappears into a ‘…’. The best titles make people curious or elicit an emotional response. Terms like ‘video’, ‘how-to’, and ‘tutorial’ are often typed into people’s searches so if they apply to your video it can help to put them in the title.</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> A short synopsis of your video which includes your most important keyword. You have about three lines before your text is hidden by a ‘show more’ tab. If you are including the URL of your channel or other videos then you should make sure they are above the ‘show more’.</p><p> <strong>Tags:</strong> Use a lot of them. These are the keywords and terms people will be searching for when they find your video. YouTube will suggest some after you start adding. A quick way to find good keywords to use is to search for videos similar to yours and check out their tags. A while ago YouTube started hiding video tags by default but you can download a free, YouTube-certified, extension for Google Chrome which will allow you to see them from vidIQ.com.</p><h4 id="4-Digging-Deeper"><a href="#4-Digging-Deeper" class="headerlink" title="4.  Digging Deeper"></a>4.  Digging Deeper</h4><p>To get your viewers to subscribe to your channel you will need to make sure your videos are not losing quality when you upload them. Here are some things to be aware of if you want your videos to look great on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> the number of pixels in your image. For example when a video has a resolution of 1080p that means it has a grid of pixels that is 1920 x 1080. The more pixels you have the sharper your image.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong>  Bitrate is a measurement of how compressed your file is, and the less compressed it is the more information there is per frame. Higher bitrates mean larger file sizes.</p><p>Your <strong>resolution</strong> and <strong>bitrate</strong> should complement each other. If you have a higher bitrate than is needed for your video’s resolution your file will be unnecessarily large. If your bitrate is too low for your resolution then you will not see the quality you expect.</p><p>YouTube has a list of recommended resolutions and bitrates at support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;answer&#x2F;1722171.</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> the dimensions of your video, in terms of width and height. YouTube’s aspect ratio is 16:9, so your videos should also be 16:9. If they are not then you will get black bars on either side of your video after you upload it. The most common way that people end up with the wrong aspect ratio is by creating videos on their smartphones and holding them up and down instead of sideways.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube"></a>Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube</h2><p>Uploading YouTube Video on Desktop:</p><p>1. Sign in to your YouTube account</p><p>2. Hit the upload button</p><p>3. Select your video type (Public, Private, Unlisted)</p><p>4. Manage the upload</p><p>5. Choose your thumbnail</p><h4 id="Step-1-Sign-in-to-your-YouTube-account"><a href="#Step-1-Sign-in-to-your-YouTube-account" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Sign in to your YouTube account"></a>Step 1: Sign in to your YouTube account</h4><p>In order to upload videos to YouTube, the very first thing you need to do is sign in. The <strong>sign-in</strong> button is located at the top right corner of the YouTube homepage. If you have multiple accounts registered to one device, you will be asked to choose one to log in to.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-signin.jpg"                      alt="sign in YouTube account"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Hit-the-upload-button"><a href="#Step-2-Hit-the-upload-button" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Hit the upload button"></a>Step 2: Hit the upload button</h4><p>It is a simple step that you will have to follow right after you log in to YouTube. As soon as you enter YouTube, after using your Google account and password for login, you will find the upload button in the top right corner of the screen. Click on this button and it will take you to the dedicated upload page.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Select-your-video-type-Public-Private-Unlisted"><a href="#Step-3-Select-your-video-type-Public-Private-Unlisted" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Select your video type (Public, Private, Unlisted)"></a>Step 3: Select your video type (Public, Private, Unlisted)</h4><p>Choose your audience. If you wish to make your video available to everyone on YouTube, simply go to the privacy settings and choose the <strong>“Public”</strong> option from the drop-down menu.</p><p>If you do not want your video to be searchable, but still want to be able to easily share a link to it with your friends and family, choose the <strong>“Unlisted”</strong> option.</p><p>Those who wish to keep their video personal can choose the <strong>“Private</strong>” option from the drop-down menu. You can still share a private video with a limited number of people (as long as they have Google accounts).</p><p>The <strong>“Scheduled”</strong> option is available for choosing a future date and time to make the video available to viewers. Once you have selected your privacy level, simply upload your video from your device storage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-youtube-privacy-setting.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Upload"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Manage-the-upload"><a href="#Step-4-Manage-the-upload" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Manage the upload"></a>Step 4: Manage the upload</h4><p>As soon as you have confirmed your video upload, you will find a progress bar on the screen. It will take some time depending on factors such as the resolution of the video and how long it is. In the meanwhile, you can write a title, description and add relevant tags for your video so that YouTube knows what search results to include it in and viewers can find it. Remember that YouTube is the second biggest search engine on the Internet, so take some time to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >optimize your keywords <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Choose-your-thumbnail"><a href="#Step-5-Choose-your-thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Choose your thumbnail"></a>Step 5: Choose your thumbnail</h4><p>Once your video uploading is complete, it is time to choose a creative thumbnail for your video. The system provides you with three options to choose from automatically, all of which will be screenshots from your video. It is usually better to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload your own custom thumbnail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, as thumbnails are a very important factor in attracting viewers. Hit the “Done” button or use the “Publish” button to finalize your upload.</p><p>That’s how to upload a video on YouTube!

If you are a YouTube Partner, that means you are earning revenue from the ads being shown before and during your videos.</p><p>Before you dive into the below guide, you may need a video editor to start your monetizing on Youtube. Filmora video editor will be the best choice.</p><p>Becoming a skilled video editor takes years of practice, but with Wondershare Filmora video editor, you can produce YouTube videos that have a professional look and feel, even if you are new to the world of video editing. This YouTube Video Creator has big icons and an intuitive interface, so those YouTubers who edit videos for the first time can quickly make a video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-split-button.jpg"                      alt="legend"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Qualifying-for-the-YouTube-Partner-Program"><a href="#Qualifying-for-the-YouTube-Partner-Program" class="headerlink" title="Qualifying for the YouTube Partner Program"></a><strong>Qualifying for the YouTube Partner Program</strong></h2><p>In order to qualify for YPP, you need to prove that you’re creating consistent, original, content and that people are watching your content. YouTube believes that has been proven when you reach these qualifications:</p><ol><li>1000 Subscribers</li><li>4000 Hours of Watch Time (over the past 12 months)</li></ol><p>Not quite there yet?

YouTube may review your content and demonetize you if you seem to have stopped posting videos, but this will not be automatic.</p><p>Remember: meeting these milestones does not grant you automatic monetization.</p><p>You can apply for YPP when you reach the milestones above, but your channel will still need to be reviewed by a human working for YouTube. Reviewers will be watching for:</p><ol><li>Nudity or sexual content</li><li>Harmful, dangerous, threatening, or hateful content</li><li>Violent or graphic content</li><li>Harassment or cyberbullying</li><li>Spam, scams, and misleading metadata</li><li>Copyright infringement or impersonation</li><li>Privacy violations</li><li>Fake subscribers</li><li>Other guidelines violations</li></ol><p>If your content violates any of YouTube’s Community Guidelines you may be denied monetization.

You must be over 18 to create an AdSense account. YouTube creators under 18 can link to the AdSense accounts of their parents or guardians.</p><p>Here’s how to sign up for AdSense through YouTube:</p><ol><li>Under <strong>Channel &gt;</strong> <strong>Status and features</strong> in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong>, look for Paid content. Click where it says <strong>‘active AdSense account’</strong>.</li><li>On the following ‘Monetization’ screen, click <strong>Next</strong> to go to AdSense.</li><li>You will be asked whether you want to use the Google account you’re already signed in to for AdSense, or if you want to use a different account.</li><li>The next step is ‘Your Website’. This will automatically be filled in with your channel. Click <strong>Accept association</strong> if it’s right.</li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> you can only have one AdSense account. Do not make a second one if you already have one. Duplicate accounts may be banned, which will stop you from monetizing your videos.</p><h2 id="What-is-Ad-Friendly-content"><a href="#What-is-Ad-Friendly-content" class="headerlink" title="What is Ad Friendly content?"></a><strong>What is Ad Friendly content?</strong></h2><p>Not all content that meets YouTube’s Community Guidelines will be considered ‘advertiser-friendly’. Companies don’t want to run ads alongside content that doesn’t match the values of their brands.</p><p>YouTube may disable ads on any video it doesn’t think is ad-friendly. Videos which may be flagged as inappropriate for ads include (but are not limited to):</p><ol><li>Videos that cover controversial or sensitive subjects.</li><li>Videos depicting the use of drugs or dangerous products.</li><li>Videos may encourage harmful or dangerous behavior.</li><li>Videos with swearing (but not ALL videos with swearing – quantity and context are factors).</li><li>Videos which contain hate speech.</li><li>Videos that depict family entertainment characters (i.e. Disney princesses) engaged in inappropriate behavior (even if you’re being satirical).</li></ol><p>If you want to make sure all of your content is advertiser-friendly, here are some best practices suggested by YouTube:</p><ol><li>Be respectful of your viewers and any people or groups you may include or mention in your video.</li><li>Extend this respectful tone to your thumbnails and video titles, and make sure your thumbnails and metadata accurately depict your video’s content.</li><li>Don’t try to monetize videos that already contain ads (i.e. <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/154235" >paid product placement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982459">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982459">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982459%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982459/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Get-Paid-Through-AdSense"><a href="#How-to-Get-Paid-Through-AdSense" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Paid Through AdSense"></a><strong>How to Get Paid Through AdSense</strong></h2><p>In order to receive a payment from AdSense, you need to earn at least $100.</p><p>For example, if you only earn $10 in a month, you will not receive a payment that month. You will not lose that $10 – you will receive it when your total earnings reach or exceed $100.</p><p>You will also need to provide AdSense with tax information and verify your identity and address in order to start being paid.</p><p>The most popular way to get paid through AdSense is via an EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer). To receive your payments this way, you’ll need to link your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><p>Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Log in to <a href="https://www.google.com/AdSense"><strong>AdSense</strong></a>.</li><li>Click <strong>Settings</strong> in the menu on the left, and then select <strong>Payments</strong>.</li><li>On the Payments page, click <strong>Manage payment options</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Add payment method</strong>.</li><li>You’ll be prompted to add your bank account details.</li><li>Make sure the name on your AdSense account matches the name on your bank account (if you’re under 18 and cannot make your own AdSense account, this may mean you’re using your parent or guardian’s bank account).</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2114264/17093" target="_top" id="2114264">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2114264" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2114264/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-YouTube-Videos-Get-the-Highest-Paying-Ads"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Videos-Get-the-Highest-Paying-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Videos Get the Highest Paying Ads?"></a><strong>Which YouTube Videos Get the Highest Paying Ads?</strong></h2><p>Not all ads pay the same, and not all videos will be able to attract the ads that pay the most.</p><p>How much money your video has the potential to earn depends on:</p><ol><li>The size of your channel</li><li>Your niche on YouTube</li><li>The specific topic of the video</li></ol><p>That the size of your channel matters probably isn’t a surprise. The biggest brands want to run their ads beside videos that are getting more views.</p><p>Whether or not your YouTube niche has a high potential for profit will depend on a couple things:</p><ol><li><strong>How many other channels are in your niche?</strong></li></ol><p>The more people there are making similar videos to you, the thinner the available ads are spread.</p><ol><li><strong>How many cheap or expensive products are being advertised in your niche?</strong></li></ol><p>If the products are free or inexpensive (i.e. free online games) then that limits your earning ability. In large niches like gaming, the few higher paying ads will go to the most popular channels and the low-paying ads will be spread amongst everyone else.</p><p>If you have a very specific niche, i.e. luxury cars, then you will have less competition and the ads available will likely be for more expensive products (and thus the ads themselves will be higher paying).</p><p>Even if you are in a large niche, you can still make videos on specific topics designed to attract higher-paying ads and more revenue. Pay attention to the analytics in your Creator Studio to learn which of your videos earn the most. Then, make more videos on similar topics to boost your earnings.</p><p>Another factor that can affect what ads appear alongside your videos is the viewing habits of individual viewers. People are shown ads that YouTube believes are more relevant to their interests.</p><h2 id="Useful-Terminology-CPM-CPC-CPV"><a href="#Useful-Terminology-CPM-CPC-CPV" class="headerlink" title="Useful Terminology (CPM, CPC, CPV)"></a><strong>Useful Terminology (CPM, CPC, CPV)</strong></h2><p>A lot of people think your ad revenue is determined by your view count. This isn’t true – it’s determined by ad impressions.</p><p>How much revenue you earn from the ads running around your videos depends on these three things:</p><p><strong>CPC:</strong> ‘cost per click’. Most of the ads on YouTube are CPC, meaning that an ad impression is only recorded when an ad is clicked on.</p><p><strong>CPV:</strong> ‘cost per view’. Skippable pre-roll ads are the only ads on YouTube which record ad impressions without clicks. These ads record ad impressions when viewers watch 30 seconds of the ad instead of skipping it.</p><p><strong>CPM:</strong> ‘cost per mille’ or ‘cost per thousand’. This refers to how much money gets paid out for 1000 ad impressions.</p><p>Your CPM will be affected by a multitude of things including the ads themselves and the size of your channel. AdSense has made it a rule that you cannot disclose your CPM to anyone, which makes it difficult to determine what you should expect.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> never click on ads near your own videos or instruct your viewers&#x2F;friends to do so.

But with no experience or training, it’s hard to know how to start a vlog and make money.</p><p>Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered!</p><p>This course shows you how to launch a profitable YouTube channel and monetize your new channel. You’ll learn everything you need to know, from finding your niche and the best ways to promote your vlog. Once your vlog starts getting views, you’ll see how to turn your viewers into subscribers, make money, and become a YouTube sensation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-1.jpg"                      alt="start vlog and make money"                ></p><p><strong>Background of vlogs on YouTube</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-2.jpg"                      alt="background of vlogs on youtube"                ></p><p>What started off as a way for vloggers to share their thoughts about topics they were passionate about eventually turned into a full-blown industry. According to Pew Research, there are more than two million vloggers, and the audience for vlogs has grown from around 200 million viewers in 2012 to over 700 million in 2017. Vloggers like Logan Paul, HJ Evelyn, Ur Mom Ashley, and Roman Atwood are some names helping to shape the industry.</p><p><strong>Why vlogs are loved by people</strong></p><p>Vlogs are short, informal videos posted online on platforms like YouTube. Think of them as the modern equivalent of early television (TV) shows. They allow creators to connect directly with their audiences, share their opinions, and be creative in a way that wasn’t possible before. They can be fun, entertaining, informational, and even educational.</p><p>But most importantly, they’re easy to make and easy to watch. The most popular ones out there are HJ Evelyn and UR Mom Ashley. Their videos are pure chaos and fun to watch.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">YouTube Ads</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Brand Sponsorship</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Affiliate Marketing</a></li><li><a href="#part3-4">Patreon</a></li><li><a href="#part3-5">Sell your service or products</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Hot FAQs on How To Start a Vlog and Make Money</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?</h2><p>So you’ve started filming videos on YouTube vlogs, but why aren’t you making any money from them? Is it something you can change? Let’s look at some common reasons why vloggers aren’t making any income and figure out how to get around them.</p><h3 id="Who-is-my-target-audience"><a href="#Who-is-my-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Who is my target audience?"></a>Who is my target audience?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg"                      alt="target audience"                ></p><p>So, let’s be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they’re not making money because they haven’t figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren’t making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they’re trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.</p><h3 id="What-problems-am-I-solving"><a href="#What-problems-am-I-solving" class="headerlink" title="What problems am I solving?"></a>What problems am I solving?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg"                      alt="problem solving"                ></p><p>It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren’t making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.</p><h3 id="What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience"><a href="#What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="What solutions am I offering?

Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?</h3><p>The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you’re addressing the target audience’s needs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel"></a>Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel</h2><p>It’s easy to get started on YouTube. Go to the website, set up a free account, and upload videos. But when it comes to growing a profitable vlog YouTube channel, there are some tricks to getting the best results. Here are the three things you must do to achieve the success that will bring you money.</p><h3 id="Find-your-niche-what-is-a-niche-and-how-to-find"><a href="#Find-your-niche-what-is-a-niche-and-how-to-find" class="headerlink" title="Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)"></a>Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)</h3><p>A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you’re passionate about and what you’re good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you’re offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.</p><h3 id="Consistency-and-patience"><a href="#Consistency-and-patience" class="headerlink" title="Consistency and patience"></a>Consistency and patience</h3><p>Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people’s interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><h3 id="Content-quality"><a href="#Content-quality" class="headerlink" title="Content quality"></a>Content quality</h3><p>With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it’s clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative. YouTube’s algorithm favors videos with large numbers of views, so if you’re looking to start a profitable vlog YouTube channel, you’ll need to add quality, creativity, and useful content for viewers.</p><p>And to do that, you must try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video editing software.

This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn’t. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let’s break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137411/7443" target="_top" id="2137411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="YouTube-Ads"><a href="#YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Ads"></a>YouTube Ads</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg"                      alt="youtube advertising"                ></p><p>Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don’t let a video with few views make you think you can’t make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.</p><p>According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser’s actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.</p><h3 id="Brand-Sponsorship"><a href="#Brand-Sponsorship" class="headerlink" title="Brand Sponsorship"></a>Brand Sponsorship</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg"                      alt="sponsorship"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134247/18498" target="_top" id="2134247">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134247" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134247/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.</p><p>Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.</p><h3 id="Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Marketing"></a>Affiliate Marketing</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg"                      alt="youtube affiliate marketing"                ></p><p>Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it’s through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.</p><h3 id="Patreon"><a href="#Patreon" class="headerlink" title="Patreon"></a>Patreon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-9.jpg"                      alt="support on patreon"                ></p><p>Patreon is another option, and if done correctly, it can turn a niche blog into a revenue source, which is great for bloggers and vloggers alike.

Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.</p><h3 id="Sell-your-service-or-products"><a href="#Sell-your-service-or-products" class="headerlink" title="Sell your service or products"></a>Sell your service or products</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-10.jpg"                      alt="sell products or services"                ></p><p>With over 1 billion monthly active users, there’s an opportunity for content creators to make money by selling their products or services. You could sell your physical products to your audience as a vlogger. The best method this can be done is by creating an online store that sells T-shirts and mugs with your branding. Make sure those products must be related to your niche or channel category.

Is it something you can change? Let’s look at some common reasons why vloggers aren’t making any income and figure out how to get around them.</p><h3 id="Who-is-my-target-audience-1"><a href="#Who-is-my-target-audience-1" class="headerlink" title="Who is my target audience?"></a>Who is my target audience?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg"                      alt="target audience"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135358/19272" target="_top" id="2135358">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135358" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135358/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>So, let’s be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they’re not making money because they haven’t figured out the right audience for their videos.

It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they’re trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.</p><h3 id="What-problems-am-I-solving-1"><a href="#What-problems-am-I-solving-1" class="headerlink" title="What problems am I solving?"></a>What problems am I solving?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg"                      alt="problem solving"                ></p><p>It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today.

A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people’s interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos.

This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn’t. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let’s break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Ads-1"><a href="#YouTube-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Ads"></a>YouTube Ads</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg"                      alt="youtube advertising"                ></p><p>Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don’t let a video with few views make you think you can’t make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.</p><p>According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser’s actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.</p><h3 id="Brand-Sponsorship-1"><a href="#Brand-Sponsorship-1" class="headerlink" title="Brand Sponsorship"></a>Brand Sponsorship</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg"                      alt="sponsorship"                ></p><p>While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.</p><p>Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.</p><h3 id="Affiliate-Marketing-1"><a href="#Affiliate-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Marketing"></a>Affiliate Marketing</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg"                      alt="youtube affiliate marketing"                ></p><p>Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it’s through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.</p><h3 id="Patreon-1"><a href="#Patreon-1" class="headerlink" title="Patreon"></a>Patreon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-9.jpg"                      alt="support on patreon"                ></p><p>Patreon is another option, and if done correctly, it can turn a niche blog into a revenue source, which is great for bloggers and vloggers alike. By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.</p><h3 id="Sell-your-service-or-products-1"><a href="#Sell-your-service-or-products-1" class="headerlink" title="Sell your service or products"></a>Sell your service or products</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-10.jpg"                      alt="sell products or services"                ></p><p>With over 1 billion monthly active users, there’s an opportunity for content creators to make money by selling their products or services.

Creating custom channel art is a great way to express yourself and communicate the tone of your videos.</p><p>YouTube supports JPG, GIF, BMP, and PNG files for channel art, although they do not allow animated GIFs.</p><h4 id="Part-1-Top-Sites-for-YouTube-Channel-Art"><a href="#Part-1-Top-Sites-for-YouTube-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Top Sites for YouTube Channel Art"></a><strong>Part 1: Top Sites for YouTube Channel Art</strong></h4><p>You can make your channel art in Photoshop, or another photo editing program, but there are also some excellent tools online which you can access for free. Here are two of the best:</p><p><strong>Canva.com</strong></p><p>Canva has templates for YouTube banners as well as a variety of stock images. You can also upload and edit your own images on Canva. It is a free service, but they do have some premium features which cost $1 each. Canva has a desktop version and an iPad app.</p><p><strong>PicMonkey.com</strong></p><p>PicMonkey lets you import images from your computer or social media accounts, edit them, and use them in templates for YouTube banners or other kinds of social media graphics. It’s free to use, but you can only access their more advanced editing tools if you buy a paid subscription for either $4.99 a month, or $2.75 a month for a year.</p><h4 id="Part-2-Banners"><a href="#Part-2-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Banners"></a><strong>Part 2: Banners</strong></h4><p>Your banner is the header for your channel page. Its dimensions are 2560 x 1440 px.</p><p>Not all of your banner will be visible on all devices. The full 2560 x 1440 px image will only be seen by viewers watching on tv screens.</p><p>Only 1546 x 423 px of your banner will be visible on computers, and this ‘safe area’ can vary for different tablets and smartphones depending on the width of their screens. Make sure any important text or logos are placed in a central location so everybody can see them.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that your icon will hover over the top left corner of your banner and that your social media icons will be located in the bottom right corner.</p><p>The file size of your banner cannot be over 4MB.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Icons"><a href="#Part-3-Icons" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Icons"></a><strong>Part 3: Icons</strong></h4><p>Your icon is the avatar you use when leaving and replying to comments on YouTube. It also hovers over your banner on your channel page.</p><p>By default, your icon will be the picture associated with your Google account.</p><p>If you upload a new icon, it will render down to 98 x 98 px. So, any square image larger than 98 x 98 px will work. However, YouTube recommends you use one as large as 800 x 800 px. This will give you a sharper, higher quality, image.</p><h4 id="Part-4-Thumbnails"><a href="#Part-4-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Thumbnails"></a><strong>Part 4: Thumbnails</strong></h4><p>Thumbnails are the images that represent your videos on your channel page and in search results.</p><p>You can browse through your video and choose a still frame you want to use as your video’s thumbnail. Or, you can upload a custom image.</p><p>Custom thumbnails should have an aspect ratio of 16:9, the same as YouTube’s video player. The files should be under 2MB and have a resolution of 1280 x 720.</p><p>To upload a custom thumbnail, select the <strong>custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video Thumbnails</strong> at the end of the video uploading process. You can also change the thumbnails of your existing videos to custom ones through <strong>Video Manager</strong>.</p><p>Remember that your thumbnail will be rendered down to a much smaller size. If you use text, like the title of your video, then you should make it really big so that it is easy to read when it gets shrunk down.</p><h4 id="Part-5-Watermarks"><a href="#Part-5-Watermarks" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Watermarks"></a><strong>Part 5: Watermarks</strong></h4><p>A watermark is a small, usually 50 x 50 px image displayed in the bottom right corner of your video.</p><p>Watermarks protect your videos by making them harder for others to steal and take credit for.</p><p>Ideally, your watermark will be a transparent version of your logo. Try not to use more than three colors – you do not want your watermark to distract your viewers.</p><p>If you add a <strong>branding watermark</strong> through YouTube then that watermark will also double as a subscribe link.</p><p>Here is how you can add a branding watermark through YouTube:</p><ol><li>On YouTube, go to your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> and select <strong>Branding</strong> under the <strong>Channel</strong> menu.</li><li>Click the blue <strong>add a watermark</strong> button on the <strong>Branding</strong> page.</li><li>An <strong>upload of a watermark</strong> window will pop up.

From there, click into the Analytics tab in the menu on the left of your screen.</p><p>In order to check which of your videos are performing the best, click on <strong>Watch time</strong> under <strong>Watch time reports</strong>. At the top of the page there’ll be a graph of your watch time in general, and if you scroll down you’ll see a list of your videos ranked by watch time. The best performing ones will be at the top and, to see more stats related to these high-performing videos, simply click on their titles. Afterwards, you’ll be able to click around the different sections in your Analytics and see reports relating to the specific video you clicked on.</p><p>The two main types of analytics reports are Watch Time Reports and Interaction Reports.</p><h3 id="1-Interpreting-YouTube-Watch-Time-Reports"><a href="#1-Interpreting-YouTube-Watch-Time-Reports" class="headerlink" title="1. Interpreting YouTube Watch Time Reports"></a>1. Interpreting YouTube Watch Time Reports</h3><p>To find <strong>Watch time reports</strong> you just need to log into your Google account, go to the <strong>Creator studio</strong>, click the analytics tab, and then click on <strong>watch time</strong>. You can see the watch time of every video on your channel, which is important data to have because watch time is the most important factor when it comes to ranking your video in search results.</p><p>A watch time report includes the total amount of time that your video, or a selection of videos, is actually being watched for. In order to make sure that you are publishing only quality videos you need to make sure that your viewers are consistently sticking to your videos and watching them all away through, or at least to the half-way mark. Watch time represents one of the most meaningful metrics in ensuring that you are engaging your audience.</p><p>YouTube analytics can now display a watch time of every video that you have produced. Seeing the metrics on how long people are actually watching every video that you produce can show you what you’ve done right in the past and what you need to do more of to continue raising your watch time.</p><p>Alongside watch time you can see the average duration individual viewers are watching your videos for. The average percentage of your video that gets viewed will showcase areas where you may be struggling with your video content. For example, if an abnormally high number of viewers are clicking away during your intro, there’s probably something about that clip that needs to be changed.</p><p>In the watch time reports for individual videos, you will be able to see data on where your views are coming from and which demographics are watching the most. Where your viewers are watching, in terms of desktop or mobile, is also interesting data that is available in this section.</p><p>Click here for more tips on<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/12-proven-ways-to-increase-youtube-views-315.html" >increasing your views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135369/19272" target="_top" id="2135369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135369/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Interpreting-YouTube-Interaction-Reports"><a href="#2-Interpreting-YouTube-Interaction-Reports" class="headerlink" title="2. Interpreting YouTube Interaction Reports"></a>2. Interpreting YouTube Interaction Reports</h3><p>Interaction reports are related to the actions viewers take – i.e. subscribing to your channel, liking your videos, or leaving a comments. You can find interaction reports in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics</strong>.</p><p>Interaction reports can be broken down into several different reports that can help determine the overall performance of any YouTube videos. The main interaction reports that you should be interested in include:</p><p><strong>1. Subscribers:</strong> You can find extensive data on your subscribers, like demographics including age groups and gender. Learning more about your subscribers can help you to tailor your content. For example, if you learn that your viewers are mostly young women under 24 in the USA, you can do research into what is currently popular with young women under 24 in the USA.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Want to see your subscriber count in real-time? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>2. Likes and dislikes:</strong> Likes and dislikes aren’t a powerful metric when it comes to search engine rankings, but they provide useful information to creators. If you’re getting a lot of dislikes on a video, you should look into why. If you’re getting a lot of likes on a video, it can indicate that you should focus on creating similar content.</p><p><strong>3. Playlists:</strong> A viewer watching a video in a playlist is much more likely to keep watching more videos from that playlist, making playlists great for the growth of your channel. Reports in this section will help you figure out which of your playlists is performing best, which could give you an idea of which types of videos or video topics are going over best with your viewers.</p><p><strong>4. Comments:</strong> Reading comments is a great way to figure out what your viewers think, but that’s not all they’re good for. If viewers return to a video to continue talking to you or other viewers then that will drive up your views and watch time. If a video is especially good at generating discussion, you should figure out why (i.e. your sign-off question) and keep doing it.</p><p><strong>5. Sharing:</strong> Discovering where your video is being shared can be important for figuring out what platforms you should be on besides YouTube. If your video is shared and viewed a lot on Twitter, you should consider making a Twitter account for your channel.</p><p><strong>6. Cards:</strong> Tracking the performance of your Cards will help you optimize them to direct traffic between your videos. By testing out different time stamps for cards you’ll find the perfect places to put them. By trying different messages in your cards you’ll learn how to write ‘calls to action’ that mobilize your viewers.</p><p><strong>End screens:</strong> End Screens are essential for keeping viewers on your channel. The report of the click-through rates of your end screens is important for helping you figure out which kinds of links work, and which style of ends screen is most effective for you. Are people more likely to click when you talk to them through the end screen, or when it’s a static card?</p><p><strong>7. 360 heat map reports:</strong> A heat map report works specifically with 360° videos if you are choosing to engage your audience with this type of content. Viewing YouTube video statistics for 360° heat maps will help to show the areas on your video that viewers are most interested in.</p><h2 id="How-to-View-Other-Peoples-YouTube-Statistics"><a href="#How-to-View-Other-Peoples-YouTube-Statistics" class="headerlink" title="How to View Other Peoples YouTube Statistics"></a>How to View Other Peoples YouTube Statistics</h2><p>If you want to check out the statistics of rival YouTube channels (<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-subscriber-chart---the-5-most-subscribed-youtube-channels-320.html" >including the most subscribed channels on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>), or channels you’re a fan of, try using <a class="link"   href="http://www.socialblade.com/" >Social Blade <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
