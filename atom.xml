It’s not. Don’t do it.</p><p>Seeing your videos get just a handful of views even though they are nicely filmed and cover interesting topics can be frustrating.

However, low prices for such services are the first sign that something isn’t right because getting hundreds of subscribers for just $5 is unrealistic.</p><p><a href="https://viralyft.com/buy-youtube-subscribers"><strong>Viralyft</strong>:</a> There are many ways to grow your YouTube channel, and buying subscribers is one of the most dangerous ways, since it may result in penalties that will ruin your YouTube channel. Viralyft is offering 500 worldwide subscribers for $49.99, and they provide no information about the delivery method. You should always ask questions about the delivery method before doing business with a service like this.</p><p>One thing they do promise is that the subscribers you can buy from them are safe, but they offer no proof that you will not be caught.</p><p><a href="http://www.view2.be/buy-youtube-subscribers/"><strong>View2be:</strong></a> View2Be offers 500 subscribers for $45. This is a more realistic price than $5, but the delivery time they are promising could be risky. A sudden increase in subscribers within 24 to 72 hours could raise a red flag with YouTube’s algorithm suspicion.</p><p>View2Be does guarantee to give you your money back if they don’t deliver subscribers.</p><p>A better alternative to buying subscribers from View2be might be their view exchange platform, in which you earn real human views on your videos by watching other people’s videos.</p><p><a href="https://zeru.com/buy-youtube-views"><strong>ZERU:</strong></a> A huge number of clients that are advertised as a sort of a guarantee that the ZERU provides reliable services. This is somewhat misleading because it diverts the attention from the truly important information. There is no sign of delivery method explanations (where do the subscribers come from?), only a promise that they will deliver the subscribers within a day or two.</p><p>You want to know where your subscribers are coming from. If you are an American YouTuber, for example, and you suddenly receive a large number of subscribers from Asian countries then that will be suspicious of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><p>YTView’s claim that subscribers you will be buying are 100% real isn’t supported by any other fact featured on their website. ZERU will sell you a hundred subscribers for $20.</p><p><a href="https://www.qqtube.com/"><strong>QQTube</strong>:</a> For only $25 you can get 10,000 subscribers per day, which is one of the cheapest offers on the market. That delivery window could look suspicious to YouTube, but if that’s a risk you’re willing to take then with QQTube at least you won’t be risking a lot of money.</p><p>QQTube’s website doesn’t mention anything about safety, which is worrying, but they do offer geographic targeting which is important.</p><p><a href="http://socialgrand.com/buy-youtube-subscribers/"><strong>SocialGrand:</strong></a> Social Grand offers 500 subscribers for $34,90 or a thousand subscribers for $62,90. They promise to get your YouTube channel a better reputation, which is a huge claim that we would be wary of.</p><p>Their argument that their service is cost-effective and that it will earn you money is not only a cause for concern, but it is dangerous as well because penalties for fake subscribers on AdSense are much harsher than on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Top-3-Ways-to-Get-Free-Subscribers"><a href="#Top-3-Ways-to-Get-Free-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Top 3 Ways to Get Free Subscribers"></a>Top 3 Ways to Get Free Subscribers</h2><p>YouTube’s community and YouTube’s algorithm both favor authenticity, and for that reason, these organic ways to get subscribers will have a much stronger impact on your YouTube channel than any amount of subscribers you can buy.</p><p>Buying subscribers creates the illusion of short-term growth, while these free methods will result in real long-term growth.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Master SEO:</strong></a>If you would like to grow your YouTube channel, then mastering SEO is the right way to go. Use keywords in the titles of your videos, playlists, and your videos’ descriptions.</p><p>Many powerful keyword research tools can help you find the best keywords for your videos. One simple method is to simply search for your topic on Google and YouTube and see what other content creators are using to rank well.</p><p>A good performance in search rankings can only be achieved by strategic thinking and careful planning, so before you upload a video to YouTube do a little research to find the best keywords for your videos.</p><p>You can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube SEO here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Post Consistently: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> You can hardly expect to have a loyal community of subscribers if you post videos every two or three months. Post a lot of videos and post them consistently (i.e. on the same day every week) because, if you do so, viewers will feel the anticipation and be more likely to watch your videos as soon as they are uploaded. Getting a lot of traffic in the first 24 hours of your video being uploaded is great for SEO.</p><p>If you manage to post four videos in a month, the number of subscribers to your account will grow organically, and you won’t need fake subscribers. You’ll get new subscribers for free.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Produce Collab Videos: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> Nobody can make it on their own; we all need the support of the people around us. Collaborating with other YouTubers that share your interest in the topic you are covering can be beneficial in many ways. First, when you collaborate you each introduce the other creator to a lot of new potential subscribers. Second, you begin to build a support network that you can rely on when you run into trouble (your YouTube friends may be able to share useful advice and even resources with you as you both grow).</p><p>Considering the risks, would YOU ever buy YouTube subscribers?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-how-to-fix-youtube-video-black-screen/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-getting-real-broadcast-your-life-on-youtube-using-obs/"><u>In 2024, Getting Real  Broadcast Your Life on Youtube Using OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-boosting-viewer-interest-with-optimal-video-thumbnail-sizes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Boosting Viewer Interest with Optimal Video Thumbnail Sizes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/he-secret-technique-for-instantaneous-deletion-of-youtube-discussions-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Secret Technique for Instantaneous Deletion of Youtube Discussions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/g-deep-into-youtube-launching-and-earning-your-way-for-2024/"><u>Diving Deep Into Youtube  Launching and Earning Your Way for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/-pro-tips-to-perfectly-tag-videos-and-maximize-views/"><u>[New] 5 Pro Tips to Perfectly Tag Videos and Maximize Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-effortlessly-convert-youtube-audio-top-4-low-cost-apps/"><u>[Updated] Effortlessly Convert YouTube Audio - Top 4 Low-Cost Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-grandview-media-mastering-the-art-of-selecting-a-cms/"><u>In 2024, Grandview Media  Mastering the Art of Selecting a CMS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-boost-mobile-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-before-the-plan-expires-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Your Boost Mobile Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Before the Plan Expires</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/2024-approved-create-like-a-pro-top-animation-software-for-mac-and-windows-users/"><u>2024 Approved Create Like a Pro Top Animation Software for Mac and Windows Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/premier-podcast-choices-for-gpodc-users/"><u>Premier Podcast Choices for GPodC Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/unlock-your-videographer-potential-with-youtube-studio-edition-expertise/"><u>Unlock Your Videographer Potential with YouTube Studio Edition Expertise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-picsart-mastery-in-depth-look-at-the-2024-version/"><u>[New] PicsArt Mastery  In-Depth Look at the 2024 Version</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pc-video-editors-like-gopro-quik-top-picks-and-reviews/"><u>2024 Approved PC Video Editors Like GoPro Quik Top Picks and Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/quickly-remove-google-frp-lock-on-samsung-galaxy-s24plus-by-drfone-android-unlock-remove-google-frp/"><u>Quickly Remove Google FRP Lock on Samsung Galaxy S24+</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/a-quick-guide-to-oneplus-12r-frp-bypass-instantly-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Quick Guide to OnePlus 12R FRP Bypass Instantly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/2024-approved-filmora-tutorial-create-engaging-reaction-videos-in-no-time/"><u>2024 Approved Filmora Tutorial Create Engaging Reaction Videos in No Time</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Subtitles are useful to viewers who have hearing impairments, whose first language is different from yours, or who are unable to watch your video with sound. Closed captioning can also be useful for you as a YouTuber because it helps with your SEO, or search engine optimization. Practicing better SEO can get your videos ranked higher in search results. Google and YouTube both index subtitles and transcripts much like they do your video’s description, unless you use automated captions.</p><p>This article will first explain how you can turn on subtitles for the videos you watch and then walk you through adding captions to your own videos.</p><h2 id="How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How To Turn On Captions on YouTube"></a>How To Turn On Captions on YouTube</h2><p>In order for you to be able to view subtitles for a YouTube video the uploader of the video will need to have added them, unless you change your account settings to display automatic captions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/captions-how-to-turn-on.JPG"                      alt="captions"                ></p><p>To toggle subtitles on and off click on the Closed Captioning icon in the bottom right of your video player.</p><p>If the creator of the video has not added captions then you can enable automatic captions by going into your <strong>Account Settings</strong> and selecting <strong>Playback</strong>. Check the box next to <strong>Always Show Captions</strong>, and then check   <strong>Show Automatic Captions by Speech Recognition</strong>. These captions may be flawed, but you will still be able to see the more accurate user submitted captions on videos that have them. The <strong>Always Show Captions</strong> feature may be useful not only to the hearing impaired, but to users who do not speak the same language as the video producer.</p><p>If you want to change the language of the subtitles click on the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear) next to the closed captioning icon and choose your language next to   <strong>Subtitles&#x2F;CC</strong> . If the language you want is not there select <strong>Auto-Translate</strong>  and then pick a language. Google Translate will be used to generate subtitles in your chosen language.</p><h2 id="Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps"><a href="#Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps"></a>Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to <strong>Video Manager</strong> in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> and then look at your videos. Decide which one you want to add captions to.</p><p>2. Click on the drop-down menu next to the video you want to add captions to and choose <strong>Subtitles and CC</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Add New</strong> <strong>Subtitles or CC</strong>.</p><p>4. Choose whether to create your captions, upload a file that has them, transcribe your video, use automatic captioning, or use captioning software.</p><p><strong>Create Subtitles or Closed Captions</strong> will allow you to create your subtitles on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Upload A File</strong> allows you to upload a pre-made subtitle file from your computer. Supported file types include SubRip (.srt) and SubViewer (.sbv). You cannot use a word or PDF document for your subtitles.</p><p><strong>Transcribe and Set Timings</strong> is where you can type a transcript of your video and set timings to sync it to your video. This differs from Create Subtitles or Closed Captions in that your transcript is all typed in to one text field.</p><p><strong>Use Automatic Captioning</strong> will automatically use speech recognition technology to create captions. You can edit these auto-generated captions later if there are mistakes.</p><p><strong>Use Captioning Software or Services</strong> is what you choose if you want to use a program or service to create the subtitles for your video.</p><p>The easiest way to add subtitles to your videos is to use <strong>Automatic Captioning</strong>. However, Automatic Captioning is imperfect and may result in your viewers getting a sloppy, skewed, interpretation of your video. Automatic captions are also not indexed by YouTube and Google the way subtitles you create or upload are. This means that they will not have any value to your SEO strategy. If you do not input your own captions or transcript you are missing out on an opportunity for better search engine rankings. Automatic Captions are great if you do not have time to input subtitles and need a temporary solution, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-top-10-scholarly-channels-on-youtube-for-history-aficionados/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Top 10 Scholarly Channels on Youtube for History Aficionados</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/everage-editing-to-boost-youtube-profile-impact-for-2024/"><u>[New] Leverage Editing to Boost YouTube Profile Impact for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-start-with-strategy-launching-an-online-dominant-gaming-channel/"><u>[Updated] Start with Strategy  Launching an Online Dominant Gaming Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-dialing-in-the-perfect-aspect-ratio-for-youtube-images/"><u>[Updated] Dialing in the Perfect Aspect Ratio for YouTube Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-auto-play-youtube-keep-it-hidden-stay-connected/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Auto-Play YouTube - Keep It Hidden, Stay Connected</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-free-online-tools-for-youtube-channel-starters/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Free Online Tools for YouTube Channel Starters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/o-convert-youtube-videos-to-mp3-songs-on-mac-2023-update/"><u>How to Convert YouTube Videos to MP3 Songs on Mac-2023 Update</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-apple-iphone-se-2022-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Change Location On Facebook Dating for your Apple iPhone SE (2022) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-5-best-live-stream-video-conference-recorders/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  5 Best Live Stream Video Conference Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-digital-domains-stitch-based-content-creation/"><u>[New] In 2024, Digital Domains  Stitch-Based Content Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-take-it-down-a-notch-how-to-enable-slow-motion-on-vlc-for-desktop-and-mobile/"><u>New Take It Down a Notch How to Enable Slow Motion on VLC for Desktop and Mobile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/dose-life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-my-location-on-poco-m6-pro-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Dose Life360 Notify Me When Someone Checks My Location On Poco M6 Pro 4G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-joy-amidst-confinement-prime-20-jailbreak-funny-on-fb/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Joy Amidst Confinement  Prime 20 Jailbreak Funny on Fb</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-ways-to-bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-7ipadipod-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Best Ways to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on iPhone 7/iPad/iPod</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-favorite-free-online-sites-featuring-a-variety-of-guitar-music-and-designs/"><u>New Favorite Free Online Sites Featuring a Variety of Guitar Music and Designs</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p><p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p><p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown.

They have two alternatives for customers who want to use their apps: either pay for such a lifetime purchase of the app or enjoy the free version that includes ADS. Best ad blocker for android helps eliminate ADS from apps installed on our Android devices.</p><p>Many people choose to use the free version since they can’t afford to pay for a standard app, while some opt for Mods, but the best method to avoid ADS is to use programs that block them entirely.

You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.</p><p>But what if you’ve created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we’ve put together an extensive guide on <strong>how to</strong> <strong>share a YouTube playlist</strong> on your computer and mobile devices.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><h2 id="Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work"><a href="#Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work" class="headerlink" title="Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?"></a>Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s figure out why the “Share” function doesn’t work. The “Share” function in the playlist does not work because it is set to “private,” and YouTube doesn’t allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

Viewers want to be able to see you clearly and will click away if they cannot. Natural light works great, and it’s cheap, so if it is possible you might want to consider vlogging outside. Of course, not every type of vlog is suited to the outdoors.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is unlikely you will be able to get good quality light from the lamps and ceiling lights in your home. Floor lamps can be useful for filling shadows or backlighting but are not usually powerful enough to use as your main light. Natural light is, so one way you can get around needing a lot of lighting equipment is to use a window as your main light. This is not always possible, though. If you are going to vlog from inside your house then there is a good chance you will need to invest in some lighting equipment.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Best Types of Lightning Equipment for YouTube Videos</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Should Good Lighting Equipment Feature?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Best Lights and Lighting Equipment for YouTube Video Shooting</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Types-of-Lightning-Equipment-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Types-of-Lightning-Equipment-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Types of Lightning Equipment for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1: Best Types of Lightning Equipment for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Every video no matter how long or short depends on light, more than anything else. The natural light sources are often not powerful enough to light a scene you’re trying to capture, so to avoid having to deal with underexposed footage, the best solution is to use artificial lighting. Even if you want the light in your video to be completely natural, you still have to figure out a way to get rid of shadows, which brings us back to different types of lighting equipment that can be used to increase the quality of the footage you’re producing.</p><h4 id="1-Softbox-Lights"><a href="#1-Softbox-Lights" class="headerlink" title="1.  Softbox Lights"></a>1.  Softbox Lights</h4><p>Shooting videos with only natural light will put a lot of challenges in front of you, and the best way to overcome them is to use softbox lights. These natural light emulators mimic the natural light by using diffusion panels to make the light look softer and less artificial.</p><p>Softbox lights enable you to direct light to the exact spot in the shot, and they make lighting subjects and particular parts of a scene much easier. Softboxes are available in all shapes and sizes at very reasonable prices, and they are a standard part of the equipment used for the production of YouTube videos.</p><h4 id="2-Umbrella-Lights"><a href="#2-Umbrella-Lights" class="headerlink" title="2.  Umbrella Lights"></a>2.  Umbrella Lights</h4><p>The newcomers to the world of YouTube video production are going to love using these lights. The umbrella lights provide a much broader source of light than the softbox lights and they are frequently used to light the entire scene. You can also add extra light on the video’s subject if you’re looking to get a more balanced shot.</p><p>They are portable and quite handy if you often shoot in different locations since you can easily pack and carry them to wherever you plan on shooting your next YouTube video.</p><h4 id="3-Ring-Lights"><a href="#3-Ring-Lights" class="headerlink" title="3.  Ring Lights"></a>3.  Ring Lights</h4><p>Although they are most frequently used for fashion and beauty videos, ring lights are a great option whenever you need to make sure that the subjects of the video are perfectly lit. These circular lights have an amount in the center, so the camera’s point of view is identical to the direction from which the light is coming.</p><p>Ring lights are powerful enough to provide light for an entire scene, and they also work nicely as a catch or fill light. Some of the most popular YouTubers like Casy Neistat or PewDiePie use ring lights in their videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Should-Good-Lighting-Equipment-Feature"><a href="#Part-2-What-Should-Good-Lighting-Equipment-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Should Good Lighting Equipment Feature?"></a>Part 2: What Should Good Lighting Equipment Feature?</h2><p>Now that you know which types of lights are commonly used on YouTube video sets, you can start looking at models that best fit your demands. There are thousands of different studio lights on the market, but only the best offer features that make the light setup process easier and faster. So before buying your lighting equipment, you should make sure that it has the following features.</p><h4 id="1-Adjustable-Beam-Spread"><a href="#1-Adjustable-Beam-Spread" class="headerlink" title="1.  Adjustable Beam Spread"></a>1.  Adjustable Beam Spread</h4><p>The equipment you use should allow you to control how wide the light is spreading. This is particularly useful when you want to light just one subject in the shot while keeping the rest in the dark. Lights with an adjustable beam spread to give you versatility and enable you to adapt to a wider range of scenes.</p><h4 id="2-The-Height-of-the-Light-Stand"><a href="#2-The-Height-of-the-Light-Stand" class="headerlink" title="2.  The Height of the Light Stand"></a>2.  The Height of the Light Stand</h4><p>Most lighting kits include stands, but not all stands allow you to change the height at which the light is positioned. This can largely limit your options on the set, which is why you need to check if the stand is adjustable. You’ll also want to do a background check on the stand’s durability, because low-quality stands may cause damage to the lights and other equipment.</p><h4 id="3-Portability"><a href="#3-Portability" class="headerlink" title="3.  Portability"></a>3.  Portability</h4><p>How portable your lighting equipment should be is directly related to the genre of YouTube videos you want to produce. If you are planning on shooting in studio conditions, then portability is not such an important factor, but if you want to shoot at a different location every day then portability becomes something you simply must consider.</p><h4 id="4-Accessories"><a href="#4-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="4.  Accessories"></a>4.  Accessories</h4><p>Most lightning kits include a number of handy accessories that help you achieve better results. Reflectors, barn doors, diffusers, scrims, and mounting accessories are all commonly featured in high-quality lighting kits, and you shouldn’t buy a kit that doesn’t offer at least some of the accessories we mentioned here.</p><h4 id="5-All-About-Reflectors-Diffusers"><a href="#5-All-About-Reflectors-Diffusers" class="headerlink" title="5. All About Reflectors&#x2F;Diffusers"></a>5. All About Reflectors&#x2F;Diffusers</h4><p>White reflectors are used to simply bounce light. Silver reflectors make light a bit colder-looking, and gold reflectors give things a slightly warmer, more glamourous, look. Black and translucent ‘reflectors’ are not really for bouncing light. The black reflector blocks light, which is useful if you are trying to focus your main light so it is only lighting you and not everything behind you. The translucent reflector is actually a diffuser. Diffusers are usually set up between you and your main light to soften it and make it easier on your eyes.</p><p>Reflectors are used to bounce light towards your subject. They are great for filling shadows created by your main light. This reflector is five reflectors in one: silver, gold, black, white, and translucent.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Lights-and-Lighting-Equipment-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Lights-and-Lighting-Equipment-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Lights and Lighting Equipment for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 3: Best Lights and Lighting Equipment for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Consumer-level camera sensors are nowhere close to being as sensitive to light as our eyes. So a scene that may look sufficiently lit to our eyes may be too dark for the camera. When you’re shooting video indoors, you’ll need additional lighting equipment. Here are some of the top seventeen best lighting equipment for YouTubers.</p><h3 id="List-of-the-Top-5-Best-On-Camera-LED-Lights"><a href="#List-of-the-Top-5-Best-On-Camera-LED-Lights" class="headerlink" title="List of the Top 5 Best On-Camera LED Lights"></a>List of the Top 5 Best On-Camera LED Lights</h3><p><strong>What is an On-Camera LED Light?</strong></p><p>On-Camera LED lights are LED lights that can be mounted directly onto your camera’s hot&#x2F;cold shoe (the little bracket on the top of a lot of DSLR cameras). On-camera LED lights are great for on-the-go YouTubers and YouTubers short on recording space because these lights are small and portable.</p><h4 id="1-Julius-Studio-160-LED-Light-with-4-Color-Filters"><a href="#1-Julius-Studio-160-LED-Light-with-4-Color-Filters" class="headerlink" title="1.

It has ironical expressions that give the song its speciality. These songs are different when it comes to different singers or different artists. This is because every artist has their style and speciality which they include while composing their Parody songs. It can even be in the form of general style music.</p><p>Parody culture was first recognized in the 14th century and it has been named as one of the most artistically expressed devices.</p><p>There are various types of Parodies’,</p><ul><li>Film Parody</li><li>Poetic Parody</li><li>Self- Parody</li></ul><p>Parody is more frequently used when it comes to political announcements in the U.S.A.</p><p>Parody is in no way, shape or form fundamentally ironical, and may some of the time be finished with deference and energy about the subject in question, without being a remiss snide assault.</p><p>It is also used as a communicative dialogue bridge between cultures or at times subcultures.</p><p>Each endeavor at a Parody isn’t made similarly as a satire, and in each occurrence, the specific farce would need to experience the four-factor reasonable use examination to decide if it establishes a reasonable use.</p><p>In later occasions, the term melodic parody came to connote the hilarious utilization of new messages to previous vocal pieces, just as both genuine and amusing references to specific melodic styles</p><p> <strong>Top 10 Parody Songs:</strong></p><ul><li>Amish paradise</li></ul><p>“Weird Al” Yankovic has his style when it comes to composing Parody songs. He raps the everyday difficulties faced by people in a Humorous way. The thing which most caught my eye was the fact that the surroundings were made simple but the song has its way of making one crack up with laughter. Having around 4 decades of experience in Music Yankovic was one of the most famous composers of his time. People found it lucky to have their songs Parodied down by him.</p><ul><li>I gotta feeling- College Humour:</li></ul><p>Back in the days, this was one of the most popular Parody. It got a few dazzling feedbacks which made teenagers go crazy on the song. Its lyrics define how the frat parties at colleges end up with hangovers and some hazy memories of them logging out from the world. With his cell phones and a very few clues how a drunk guy figures out what happened the night of the party is what the whole song is about.</p><ul><li>White and Nerdy:</li></ul><p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic wrote this song. It revolves around the lines that a Man ‘can’t roll with the gangsters’ because he is too ‘White and Nerdy’.</p><p>This refers to all the Nerds out there who are more concerned about computer programs, Video games, Comics, Fancy dresses like superman or watching the Stars wars movies hundreds of times. This is one of the biggest hits of the century and was considered to be one of the funniest songs ever made.</p><ul><li>She was beautiful, I swear:</li></ul><p>The Parody by Kevin sage revolves around the topic that he sees a girl on a subway but how she turned out to be a man. It starts by him swearing that he thought she was a girl, but as you all guessed reality was something much more hilariously colourful. He was too drunk to differentiate between a man and a woman. But well, it is too late to face the truth, isn’t it?</p><ul><li>Look at this Instagram- College Humour:</li></ul><p>It revolves around how the social App Instagram is used. It is used to make other people jealous of how awesome your life. At least that is how Nickelback portrays it to be. The way her picture is so cute or the food she ate is delicious. The fact that her vacation at the beach was magnificent or the dress she bought was beautiful is how the whole song is written to be. Instagram users are made fun of in a harmless way about how they seem obsessed with their puppies or kittens.</p><ul><li>Tacky:</li></ul><p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic describes the song about how tacky he is, or how he seems to eat food out of Instagram (Ironically of course). He talks about how he wears his sandals with socks or how he wears his belt with suspenders. It is a weirdly satisfying song.</p><ul><li>Fat:</li></ul><p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic wrote this song describes how fat a man is. He used Michael Jacksons song to make a Parody and this wasn’t the first time he did that. This video won the Grammy award for being the Best Concept Music Video ever. The video starts with a fat man walking and singing out all the problems he faces because of being fat.</p><ul><li>Telephone:</li></ul><p>A very famous and brilliant song. The video starts with the dialogue, “Will you tell me the concept of this telephone video or not’. This revolves around Lady Gaga. Maybe her weird costumes or her quirkiness.</p><ul><li>Gangnam style:</li></ul><p>Let’s face it, it is the most popular Parody which almost every citizen from the whole world had heard. Bark Baker has around 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube just because of this song. The most hilarious and also musically sound video which took over the entire industry with its massive hit.</p><ul><li>A complicated song:</li></ul><p>Another, massive hit by the famous “Weird Al,” Yankovic. This music video is divided into three parts. Each of them describing one of the weirdest situations the composer finds himself in. One revolves around too much pizza, the second one around the girl he loved but the fact that she was going to propose his cousin and the third one is about he almost knocked off this head while standing on a roller coaster ride.</p><p> Other famous Parody songs,</p><ul><li>Somebody that I used to know</li><li>Lose yourself</li><li>A lot</li><li>Friday</li><li>Poker face</li><li>Call me maybe</li><li>Hello</li><li>Beat it</li><li>Hooked on polkas</li><li>Boom Boom Pow</li><li>Party in the U.S.A</li><li>She’s always a woman</li><li>Best song ever</li><li>New rules</li><li>I’m a believer</li><li>All about that Bass</li><li>Tic Tok</li><li>Humble</li><li>I want a new Duck</li><li>Rehab</li><li>Blurred lines</li><li>Can’t feel my face</li></ul><p> Basics on how to make a Parody video:</p><p> Tips,</p><ul><li>Outline the structure of the song you want to write</li></ul><p>It is essential to pen down your ideas and structure it first instead of directly jumping to the finale. It can be done by putting down your primary theme at the top of the page and then penning the sub-themes. Try to simplify the meaning. Make note of all the important stuff.</p><ul><li>Try matching all the syllables</li></ul><p>Match the syllables of the Parody with the lyrics of the original composition. This is what gives the song its flavour. Start by counting the number of syllables in both the versions and try matching them as much as you can to give the same feel.</p><ul><li>Be active</li></ul><p>Don’t be lazy. Think and rethink all your ideas. Start looking for inspiration around you. Keep your mind active at all times. Who knows, something might strike you when you least expect it.</p><ul><li>Use the Thesaurus tool</li></ul><p>Make use of the internet and the tools it provides to beautify your work.</p><ul><li>Try speaking the words out loud</li></ul><p>Language can be confusing. Avoid that by speaking out loud before finalizing. This is found to be much more productive than just thinking about them in your mind.</p><ul><li>Edit and re-edit it</li></ul><p>Don’t ever submit the first draft. Edit it again and again and present the best version of it to the world.</p><ul><li>Refine the song at last</li></ul><p>Try talking about it with your family and ask them how it can be modified. Be open to suggestions and refine it as much as you can.</p><p> And voila, you have the best Parody music.</p><p> Conclusion:</p><p> A Parody is a work that is made by copying a current unique work to ridicule or remark on a part of the first. The most punctual realized spoof masses date from the late fourteenth century and the technique got basic in the fifteenth and sixteenth 100 of years. Parody, in music, initially the inventive adjusting of a few voice portions of a prior synthesis to frame another organization, as often as possible a mass; in present-day melodic use, spoof, as a rule, alludes to the comical impersonation of a genuine piece.</p><p>Spoofs can target VIPs, government officials, creators, a style or pattern, or some other intriguing subject.</p><p>Parody is significant because it permits us to condemn and address without being forceful or noxious. Or maybe, we use satire.</p><p>Few famous Parody singers, makers or Industries:</p><ul><li>Ellen DeGeneres</li><li>Weird Al Yankovic</li><li>College Humour</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/nhance-your-content-creation-with-these-top-12-cameras/"><u>[New] Enhance Your Content Creation with These Top 12 Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-blur-the-borders-enhancing-your-videos-appeal-on-yt/"><u>In 2024, Blur the Borders  Enhancing Your Video's Appeal on YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/approved-sci-ed-hacks-top-youtube-experts-to-elevate-learning/"><u>2024 Approved  Sci-Ed Hacks  Top YouTube Experts to Elevate Learning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/re-your-brand-with-smart-channel-name-genesis/"><u>Inspire Your Brand with Smart Channel Name Genesis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/-closer-look-at-earnings-comparing-dailymotion-and-youtube-revenues/"><u>[New] A Closer Look at Earnings  Comparing Dailymotion and YouTube Revenues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ist-on-a-page-embedding-yt-videos-online/"><u>Playlist on a Page  Embedding YT Videos Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/our-video-masterful-use-of-hash-tags-in-games/"><u>Ace Your Video  Masterful Use of Hash Tags in Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/o-seamlessly-upload-videos-onto-youtubes-platform-for-2024/"><u>How to Seamlessly Upload Videos Onto YouTube's Platform for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-finding-free-music-a-producers-handbook/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Finding Free Music  A Producer's Handbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/a-detailed-and-trustworthy-review-of-murfai-ai-text-to-speech-tool-for-2024/"><u>A Detailed and Trustworthy Review of Murf.ai AI Text-to-Speech Tool for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-discover-9-easy-no-cost-editing-software-options/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Discover 9 Easy, No-Cost Editing Software Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-the-art-of-growth-with-top-7-tiktok-strategies/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering the Art of Growth with Top 7 TikTok Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevate-your-visuals-creating-a-cinematic-look-with-fcpx/"><u>In 2024, Elevate Your Visuals Creating a Cinematic Look with FCPX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-leading-rogue-adventures-10-game-compilation/"><u>In 2024, Leading Rogue Adventures  #10 Game Compilation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-crafting-professional-valorant-thumbnails-for-youtube/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step  Crafting Professional Valorant Thumbnails for Youtube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/accessible-gamers-soundtrack-without-restrictions/"><u>Accessible Gamers' Soundtrack Without Restrictions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-expert-tag-analyzer-devices-for-popular-platforms-fbtwitterinsta/"><u>[New] In 2024, Expert Tag Analyzer Devices for Popular Platforms (FB/Twitter/Insta)</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The sheer amount of videos on YouTube pushes creators to upload videos that have a distinctive visual style to their channels. Adding an intro to a video you upload to YouTube can help you promote your channel, inform the audiences about new videos you’re planning to share online or briefly summarize the topic of a video.

YouTube intro templates that are available on these websites are not compatible with all video editing, animation, motion graphics, and compositing software products. Here are some of the most reliable online sources that offer a wide variety of mesmerizing YouTube intro templates.</p><h4 id="1-Filmstock"><a href="#1-Filmstock" class="headerlink" title="1.

In addition, Filmstock lets you choose from packs like Urban Opener, Dynamic Intro or Fast Pop that fit various visual styles of YouTube videos. You can use Filmostocks for free, but if you opt for this option you won’t have access to the media assets stored in the platform’s Standard Library. On the other hand, purchasing the Premium subscription plan enables you to download twenty premium assets per month and to discover new intros, effects or stock footage each day. Filmostocks is a great choice for all YouTubers who edit their videos with Filmora or other versions of this video editing software as well as Adobe After Effects.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-MotionDen"><a href="#2-MotionDen" class="headerlink" title="2.

You must create an account on Flixexpress before you can start editing the templates, but keep in mind that the free version of the platform doesn’t allow you to import your own footage or store footage for longer than one day. Opting for any of the other available subscription plans will enable you to export your videos in 1080p resolution and have access to fifty or more templates, depending on the plan you choose.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Getting the attention of millions of viewers on YouTube is much easier if you start your videos with a captivating intro that sparks curiosity.
