However, because AE is a complex application and has a steep learning curve, this section explains the two alternative ways to get the same effect on your existing video footage.</p><h2 id="Method-1-How-to-Create-Bouncing-Text-in-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Method-1-How-to-Create-Bouncing-Text-in-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: How to Create Bouncing Text in Filmora Video Editor?"></a>Method 1: How to Create Bouncing Text in Filmora Video Editor?</h2><p>When talking about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the application is populated with several presets for texts and titles, animations, effects, filters, and much more.</p><p>These pre-built templates not only make your task easier, they also save your decent amount of time that you would spend while working with After Effects or any other similar app that requires you to build things from scratch.</p><p>You can follow the instructions given below to <strong>add animated bounce text</strong> to any of your video footages with Filmora:</p><h4 id="Step-1-Add-a-Footage-to-Timeline"><a href="#Step-1-Add-a-Footage-to-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Add a Footage to Timeline"></a>Step 1: Add a Footage to Timeline</h4><p>Launch Wondershare Filmora on your Windows or Mac PC. By default, the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of the project is set to 16:9. Click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left section, and select and import footage you want to add bounce text to.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Insert-Text-and-Add-Bounce-Effect"><a href="#Step-2-Insert-Text-and-Add-Bounce-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Insert Text and Add Bounce Effect"></a>Step 2: Insert Text and Add Bounce Effect</h4><p>Click <strong>Titles</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, and click and drag your preferred title template from the Library to the timeline. In case you don’t want any specific animation or style on the title, you can use the default title.</p><p>In the timeline, double-click the title you just added, use the upper-left section to edit the text, go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab from the left pane, scroll down the list, and double-click the <strong>Up Down 1</strong> or <strong>Up Down 2</strong> preset to apply the bounce effect to the credits. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes and to get back to the main window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-up-down-animation-to-bounce.jpg"                      alt="Create Bouncing Text video Filmora9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Shake Filters</strong></p><p>Go to <strong>Effects</strong> from the standard toolbar, expand the <strong>Filters</strong> category from the left pane, and click <strong>Shake</strong>. From the Library window, click and drag your preferred shake filter to the timeline. Here, I will choose Mild.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shake-filter.jpg"                      alt="Shake filters in Filmora9"                ></p><p>You can customize the default effect by double-clicking the shake filter in the timeline, using the sliders in the upper-left area of the interface to make necessary adjustments, and then clicking <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes and to get back to the previous interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mild-shake-filter-adjust.jpg"                      alt="Mild Shake filters adjust"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Export the Final Output</strong></p><p>Click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top of the interface, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab in the <strong>Export</strong> box, choose your preferred output format from the list in the left, make required customizations from the right pane, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-filmora9-video.jpg"                      alt="Filmora9 Export Options"                ></p><p>Now, you can add the bouncing text video and the background video to the timeline, and then place the bouncing text video above the background video track.</p><p>Double click the text track, go to the <strong>Chroma Key</strong> effect, select the <strong>Color Picker</strong> tool, and click anywhere in the Preview window to get things right. Finally, export the entire project to your preferred output format as explained in <strong>Step 4</strong>.</p><p>As explained before, Wondeshare Filmora makes the entire process of creating and adding <strong>bounce text</strong> effect pretty simple. With all the pre-build templates, and the versatility of the options that can be used to customize those presets, you can come up with the effects that are usually obtained when you start generating them from the scratch.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="Method-2-Generate-Animated-Bouncing-Texts-Online"><a href="#Method-2-Generate-Animated-Bouncing-Texts-Online" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Generate Animated Bouncing Texts Online"></a>Method 2: Generate Animated Bouncing Texts Online</h2><p>If you don’t want any heavy and resource-intensive app on your PC merely for some special text effects, you can try any of the online solutions instead. The benefit of using any such web app is that all the processing is done on site’s server, and it is only a web browser and an Internet connection that you need to have at your side.</p><p>Some most trusted websites to generate <strong>bounce text</strong> are listed below:</p><h4 id="1-ENGFTO"><a href="#1-ENGFTO" class="headerlink" title="1. ENGFTO"></a>1. ENGFTO</h4><p>Website: <a class="link"   href="https://engfto.com/index/create%5Fanimated%5Fbouncing%5Ftext/0-26" >https://engfto.com/index/create%5Fanimated%5Fbouncing%5Ftext/0-26 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/engfto-create-animated-bouncing-text.jpg"                      alt="Create Animated Bouncing Text with ENGFTO"                ></p><p>You can follow the instructions given below to use Engfto to generate bouncing text for your footages:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Animated Bouncing Text Page</strong></p><p>Launch your favorite web browser, and go to the link given above to get to the Engfto’s animated bouncing text page.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Customize Text and Preferences</strong></p><p>Modify the values in the fields under the <strong>SIZE AREA</strong> and <strong>TEXT</strong> sections to customize the text area, the text itself, its size, and font. Next, adjust the values in the fields under the <strong>EFFECT PARAMETERS</strong> section to get the required bounce effect. Also, use the fields under the <strong>BACKGROUND</strong> section to either change the background color, or pick a background image from your PC.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Obtain the Animated Text</strong></p><p>Click the <strong>SAVE GIF ANIMATION</strong> button from the lower section of the page to download the animated text to your PC.</p><h4 id="2-Loading-io"><a href="#2-Loading-io" class="headerlink" title="2. Loading.io"></a>2. Loading.io</h4><p>The instructions given below explain how to use Loading.io to get animated <strong>bounce text</strong> effect for your footages:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Loading.io Webpage</strong></p><p>Launch your favorite web browser and go to <a class="link"   href="https://loading.io/animation/text/" >https://loading.io/animation/text/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Customize the Text and Choose Animation Effect</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-bouncing-text-with-loadingio.jpg"                      alt="Create Animated Bouncing Text with Loading.io"                ></p><p>Use the options available on the webpage to type your text, and change its font, color, background, transparency level etc. Select <strong>Bounce</strong> (or any of its variants) from the <strong>Animation</strong> drop-down list, and adjust the speed using the <strong>Speed</strong> slider.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Obtain the Text</strong></p><p>Click your preferred option from next to the <strong>Download As</strong> section to download the animated text to your PC.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Regardless of the web solution you choose to generate and obtain animated <strong>bounce text</strong>, you will still need a post-production tool to add the downloaded text to your footage.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Generating <strong>bounce text</strong> effect is much simpler when you use Wondershare Filmora or any of the online solutions as explained in Method 2. While the former gives you more flexibility when it comes to customizations, the latter doesn’t require any app to be installed on your PC. In addition, many times the web apps offer their services for free, and therefore they are preferred by the novice users who are not much into post-production processes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-video-valedictions-sign-off-strategies-for-online-platforms/"><u>[Updated] Video Valedictions  Sign-Off Strategies for Online Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/cket-your-youtube-speed-render-and-upload-hacks-for-2024/"><u>Skyrocket Your YouTube Speed - Render and Upload Hacks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-earnings-spectrum-unveiling-the-financial-power-of-dailymovement-and-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Earnings Spectrum  Unveiling the Financial Power of DailyMovement and YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-high-quality-video-capture-for-beginner-creators/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, High-Quality Video Capture for Beginner Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-finding-the-middle-ground-working-and-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Finding the Middle Ground  Working & YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ive-into-the-dos-and-donts-of-youtube-beauty-channels-for-2024/"><u>[New] Dive Into the Do's and Don'ts of YouTube Beauty Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-edition-the-definitive-strategy-for-youtube-monetization/"><u>[New] 2024 Edition  The Definitive Strategy for YouTube Monetization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/nhance-channel-appeal-with-free-professional-banner-designs/"><u>[New] Enhance Channel Appeal with Free, Professional Banner Designs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ase-video-traffic-key-youtube-seo-strategies-for-2024/"><u>Increase Video Traffic  Key YouTube SEO Strategies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-peering-into-the-future-of-video-capturing-with-apeaksoft/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Peering Into the Future of Video Capturing with Apeaksoft</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-3d-animation-software-free-trials-and-paid-versions/"><u>New 2024 Approved Best 3D Animation Software Free Trials and Paid Versions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-complete-guide-to-vivo-y36i-frp-bypass-everything-you-need-to-know-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The Complete Guide to Vivo Y36i FRP Bypass Everything You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/award-winning-musicians-on-youtube-you-must-see/"><u>Award-Winning Musicians on YouTube You Must See</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/how-purchasing-followers-impacts-the-integrity-of-youtube-content-creators-for-2024/"><u>How Purchasing Followers Impacts the Integrity of YouTube Content Creators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-master-quick-photo-collage-with-google-images-in-minutes/"><u>[New] Master Quick Photo Collage with Google Images in Minutes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/updated-unparalleled-pc-sound-control/"><u>[Updated] Unparalleled PC Sound Control</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-youtube-audio-made-easy-a-quick-start-guide-to-downloading/"><u>New YouTube Audio Made Easy A Quick Start Guide to Downloading</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-picking-a-reliable-youtube-mp4-converter/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide to Picking a Reliable YouTube MP4 Converter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-add-a-touch-of-personality-to-your-discord-status-a-pc-and-mobile-walkthrough/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  How to Add a Touch of Personality to Your Discord Status  A PC & Mobile Walkthrough</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The internet is full of false prophets that often provide information about this topic that is not based on facts but on profit and their personal interests.</p><p>If you have the knowledge required to give instructions to others about fitness, then creating educational YouTube videos in which you share your personal opinions (and experiences) about supplements and vitamins may be a great way to gain more followers.</p><h4 id="3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts"><a href="#3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts" class="headerlink" title="3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts"></a>3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts</h4><p>No one should be forced to pay a fortune just to keep their bodies in shape, and we no longer have to. YouTube videos that show us how to exercise at home without expensive equipment are becoming increasingly popular. Fitness experts can gain a lot of attention from YouTube’s community if they can offer cheap and effective workout techniques anyone can try at home.</p><h4 id="4-Stretch-Videos"><a href="#4-Stretch-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stretch Videos"></a>4.  Stretch Videos</h4><p>Preparation is the key to success in everything, including working out. YouTube videos that teach viewers how to prepare themselves for a workout session can help you get views on YouTube. The best part is that people can always go back to your video anytime they need the warm-up techniques you teach in your videos which means repeat views and increased watch time.</p><h4 id="5-Full-length-Workout-Videos"><a href="#5-Full-length-Workout-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5.  Full-length Workout Videos"></a>5.  Full-length Workout Videos</h4><p>There are so many different fitness techniques out there, and most fitness instructors know more than just one workout technique. Creating a series of YouTube videos that offer detailed information on how to do Pilates, cardio, stretching, or injury rehabilitation exercises could provide you with more than enough material to fill your channel with content. Full-length workout videos show the entire training from the beginning until the end.</p><h4 id="6-Yoga-Routine"><a href="#6-Yoga-Routine" class="headerlink" title="6.  Yoga Routine"></a>6.  Yoga Routine</h4><p>Mastering Yoga is a lengthy process because there are so many different styles of Yoga routines. If you are familiar with the practices of Hasyayoga, Pranayama, or Kundalini Yoga then your YouTube videos can center on the most important exercises from one or all of the different schools of Yoga. Viewers of your yoga routine videos can’t learn all the poses and exercises after watching them just once, which means they’ll keep coming back until they feel confident that they can practice yoga independently.</p><h4 id="7-Exercise-Plans"><a href="#7-Exercise-Plans" class="headerlink" title="7.  Exercise Plans"></a>7.  Exercise Plans</h4><p>We all need to stick to some kind of a plan, no matter what we do. Structuring workouts and giving people a concise plan they should follow when they get to the gym (or in their home) can be beneficial for beginners and experienced athletes alike. These types of videos are ‘evergreen’ – they don’t become dated as time passes so new and returning audiences can continue to appreciate them.</p><h4 id="8-Motivational-Video"><a href="#8-Motivational-Video" class="headerlink" title="8.  Motivational Video"></a>8.  Motivational Video</h4><p>The lack of motivation is one of the most common reasons people have trouble getting in shape. We have trouble making ourselves start. If you are a motivational figure that can inspire others to establish a healthy lifestyle you could be a hit with this type of video. Develop your own way of motivating people, and strive to create a coherent style that fits your own personal philosophy of life.</p><h4 id="9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information"><a href="#9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information" class="headerlink" title="9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information"></a>9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information</h4><p>We are what we eat, and in order to stay fit, we must pay attention to everything we take into our system. The vast majority of gym goers don’t really know much about the food they should eat after workouts or how often they should eat. This provides a window of opportunity for you as somebody who does to produce YouTube videos that offer detailed advice on dieting should and regular daily meals for staying healthy and full of energy.</p><h4 id="10-Your-Fitness-Journey"><a href="#10-Your-Fitness-Journey" class="headerlink" title="10.  Your Fitness Journey"></a>10.  Your Fitness Journey</h4><p>Every story has a beginning, so creating a video for your YouTube channel that tells the viewers how your fitness journey began and what you had to go through to get where you are can help you develop a deeper bond with your YouTube followers. You can also document the preparation process for a great challenge, like a triathlon or a marathon, and show your followers what your daily exercise routines look like.</p><h4 id="11-Weight-Loss-Advice"><a href="#11-Weight-Loss-Advice" class="headerlink" title="11.  Weight Loss Advice"></a>11.  Weight Loss Advice</h4><p>For some people, weight can be a major health concern. A few years ago, the American Medical Association has classified obesity as a disease. That’s why YouTube videos that offer advice on how to lose weight in a safe and healthy way, or which provide guidance through the process, can help you build an audience on YouTube.</p><p>Need more video ideas?

When you’re a YouTube creator, you should definitely take advantage of this desire and use a YouTube background video designed specifically with this in mind.</p><p>In this guide, we’ll go over how to get or make such a background and show you five incredible examples you can use now.</p><p><strong>YouTube Video Background</strong> Creating realistic video scenes at your will is easy to complete with Filmora green screen removal.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn Green Screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="What-Is-a-YouTube-Video-Background"><a href="#What-Is-a-YouTube-Video-Background" class="headerlink" title="What Is a YouTube Video Background?"></a>What Is a YouTube Video Background?</h2><p>A <strong>YouTube video background</strong> is a simple image or video that sits in place at the back of your videos. It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.</p><p>Even something as small as your <strong>YouTube video thumbnail background</strong> can strongly impact your results.</p><p>Obviously, choosing the right <strong>custom YouTube background</strong> is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.</p><h2 id="Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective"><a href="#Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?"></a>Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?</h2><p>There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.</p><p>The main reasons include:</p><ul><li>Creates a meaningful connection;</li><li>Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;</li><li>Builds a better brand;</li><li>Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.</li></ul><p>So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal <strong>YouTube video background download</strong>.</p><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos"></a>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.</p><h3 id="Content-Relevance"><a href="#Content-Relevance" class="headerlink" title="Content Relevance"></a>Content Relevance</h3><p>As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="Audience-Appeal"><a href="#Audience-Appeal" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.</p><h3 id="Lighting-and-Visibility"><a href="#Lighting-and-Visibility" class="headerlink" title="Lighting and Visibility"></a>Lighting and Visibility</h3><p>Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><h3 id="Personal-Branding"><a href="#Personal-Branding" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.</p><h3 id="Editing"><a href="#Editing" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p>If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a <strong>green screen background for YouTube videos</strong>.</p><h2 id="5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas"><a href="#5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas"></a><strong>5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas</strong></h2><p>It’s finally time to have a look at some examples of highly effective and engaging YouTube video backgrounds for the winter season.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><ul><li>Snowy Landscape</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-1.png"                      alt="snowy landscape youtube background"                ></p><ul><li>Festive Holiday Decor</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-2.png"                      alt="festive holiday decor image"                ></p><ul><li>Cozy Indoor Settings</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-3.png"                      alt="cozy indoor winter background"                ></p><ul><li>Winter Cityscapes</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-4.png"                      alt="winter cityscapes background"                ></p><ul><li>Animated Winter Scenes</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-5.png"                      alt="animated winter scenes background"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Create-or-Source-Winter-Backgrounds"><a href="#How-to-Create-or-Source-Winter-Backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="How to Create or Source Winter Backgrounds"></a>How to Create or Source Winter Backgrounds</h2><p>If you want to make your own winter backgrounds or simply edit the ones you have, the most effective way is to use a beginner-friendly video editing platform, such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>This type of platform has all the necessary tools, templates, and presets for professionals to use but all of it is packed in a very easy-to-use interface that anyone can get the hang of.</p><p>Just follow these steps and you’ll have the perfect winter <strong>background for YouTube</strong> in no time.</p><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Download and install the Filmora video editing tool.</p><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Run the program and click on <strong>“</strong>New Project”.

It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.</p><p>Even something as small as your <strong>YouTube video thumbnail background</strong> can strongly impact your results.</p><p>Obviously, choosing the right <strong>custom YouTube background</strong> is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.</p><h2 id="Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective-1"><a href="#Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?"></a>Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?</h2><p>There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.</p><p>The main reasons include:</p><ul><li>Creates a meaningful connection;</li><li>Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;</li><li>Builds a better brand;</li><li>Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.</li></ul><p>So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal <strong>YouTube video background download</strong>.</p><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos-1"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos"></a>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.</p><h3 id="Content-Relevance-1"><a href="#Content-Relevance-1" class="headerlink" title="Content Relevance"></a>Content Relevance</h3><p>As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="Audience-Appeal-1"><a href="#Audience-Appeal-1" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.</p><h3 id="Lighting-and-Visibility-1"><a href="#Lighting-and-Visibility-1" class="headerlink" title="Lighting and Visibility"></a>Lighting and Visibility</h3><p>Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><h3 id="Personal-Branding-1"><a href="#Personal-Branding-1" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.</p><h3 id="Editing-1"><a href="#Editing-1" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p>If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a <strong>green screen background for YouTube videos</strong>.</p><h2 id="5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas-1"><a href="#5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas-1" class="headerlink" title="5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas"></a><strong>5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas</strong></h2><p>It’s finally time to have a look at some examples of highly effective and engaging YouTube video backgrounds for the winter season.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><ul><li>Snowy Landscape</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-1.png"                      alt="snowy landscape youtube background"                ></p><ul><li>Festive Holiday Decor</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-2.png"                      alt="festive holiday decor image"                ></p><ul><li>Cozy Indoor Settings</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-3.png"                      alt="cozy indoor winter background"                ></p><ul><li>Winter Cityscapes</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-4.png"                      alt="winter cityscapes background"                ></p><ul><li>Animated Winter Scenes</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-5.png"                      alt="animated winter scenes background"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Create-or-Source-Winter-Backgrounds-1"><a href="#How-to-Create-or-Source-Winter-Backgrounds-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Create or Source Winter Backgrounds"></a>How to Create or Source Winter Backgrounds</h2><p>If you want to make your own winter backgrounds or simply edit the ones you have, the most effective way is to use a beginner-friendly video editing platform, such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>This type of platform has all the necessary tools, templates, and presets for professionals to use but all of it is packed in a very easy-to-use interface that anyone can get the hang of.</p><p>Just follow these steps and you’ll have the perfect winter <strong>background for YouTube</strong> in no time.</p><h5 id="Step-1-2"><a href="#Step-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Download and install the Filmora video editing tool.</p><h5 id="Step-2-2"><a href="#Step-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Run the program and click on <strong>“</strong>New Project”.

You can find the link in browser history, in YouTube history, or you may have shared the link on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-video-from-youtube-history.jpg"                      alt="Find deleted YouTube videos from history"                ></p><p>If you want to watch a deleted YouTube video using the Wayback Machine, you must find the link to the video you want to access; without the URL, you won’t be able to access the deleted YouTube video.</p><p>2. Head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://archive.org/" >archive.org website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and paste the YouTube video URL in the search bar and press return.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-way-back-machine1.jpg"                      alt="open way back machine"                ></p><p>3. Once you find your video on the internet archive, you can see the details of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-deleted-video2.jpg"                      alt="find deleted video"                ></p><p>4. You won’t be able to play the video directly, but you should be able to download it. Right, click the video to find the option to download the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-deleted-video3.jpg"                      alt="download deleted video"                ></p><p>This method works mostly as the Wayback machine is pretty active and regularly crawls the web to archive the sites. But sometimes, this method may not work and would require a more sophisticated way to watch deleted YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title="["></a>[<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></h2><h2 id="Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL"><a href="#Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL"></a>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</h2><p>But what if you don’t have a URL for the deleted YouTube video? The internet is a global village network. Everything on the internet is connected, and that connection makes it more useful for example, even though a YouTube video might be deleted, you can somehow access and watch the deleted YouTube videos without a URL because people always replicate videos and share them on other YouTube channels or social media platforms. To make sure you get to watch your favorite YouTube video again, we will dive into the vast internet and find the deleted YouTube videos.</p><p>This method can be a bit complicated and would require you to give full attention to find the video you want to watch that badly that you’ve landed on this article.</p><p>1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to the Google search bar. We’re going to employ a technique from the SEO expert’s toolbox – Google Search Operators.</p><p>2. In the search bar, type <strong>“site:<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/" >www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> + name Of TheVideo”</strong></p><p>3. This way Google will crawl all the name relevant videos only from the YouTube databases and move us closer to finding our deleted YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggle-crawl-url4.jpg"                      alt="google crawl url"                ></p><p>4. If you know the video was shared by someone on Facebook or any other social media platform, you can change the site URL in the search bar, replacing YouTube with Facebook, for example.</p><p>5. Once you find the video URL, you can simply go back to the first method that we discussed and paste the URL into the internet archive. The archive will give you the video and you can enjoy watching a deleted YouTube video.</p><p>Note: If you still cannot find the video using this method, I’m sorry to tell you the video may be completely deleted from the server, and you cannot access it anymore.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Want to make a YouTube video again? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a relatively lightweight and powerful platform you get an intuitive interface and the power to create wonderful, unique content.

To do so, it’s essential to provide something unique and different to the viewer. Without providing them the content they are looking for, it is impossible to grow your channel and reach. Once your content is ready and you are getting many views, it is essential to make these potential viewers your permanent viewers. The animated subscribe button will help you achieve this goal. While your viewers are watching your videos, you must remind them about subscribing to your channel for receiving such incredible content in the future. Subscribe animation plays a vital role in converting your viewers into subscribers.</p><p>There are so many platforms on the internet from where you can get Youtube subscribe button animation free, and you can also purchase these subscribe png gifs. But creating your own animated subscribe button can make you stand out from the crowd and make your videos unique and exclusive. Because it enables you to design it the way you want according to your brand, so, let’s create your own subscribe animation using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><hr><h2 id="Step-By-Step-guide"><a href="#Step-By-Step-guide" class="headerlink" title="Step-By-Step guide"></a>Step-By-Step guide</h2><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started,open Filmora X. On your upper left corner, click on the “Sample Colors,” select the Green color and drag it to Video Track into the timeline. We are using a Green background to easily remove it using the green screen feature in Filmora to use it in our future projects after exporting it, without creating it again. Adjust the duration of this track according to your requirement. In my case, I am trying to make an animated subscribe button of 5 seconds.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button1.png"                      alt="subscribe-button1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Lock this track by clicking on the lock icon to work on subscribe animation without disturbing the background easily.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button2.png"                      alt="subscribe-button2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now it’s time to design the subscribe png gif. Go to the Sample colors again and drag the red color into the time above the green background.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button3.png"                      alt="subscribe-button3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Double click on the red color in the timeline and adjust its size. Make it look like a subscribe button that is a rectangle and place it at the bottom center of the background. You can put it anywhere you want it to appear in your future videos.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button4.png"                      alt="subscribe-button4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, let’s add Subscribe text into the button. Go to the Title and select any style that you like. “Basic 6” will work perfectly fine for this purpose. Drag and drop it into the timeline above all tracks.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button5.png"                      alt="subscribe-button5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Double click on the Title on the timeline and edit it with “Subscribe” and place it under the red rectangle and click OK.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button6.png"                      alt="subscribe-button6"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> We have put a cursor that can click on the animated subscribe button. You can use Google Search to find a transparent cursor. Make sure to save it in png format. Download it and import it into Filmora.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button7.png"                      alt="subscribe-button7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Drag and drop the cursor into the timeline and place it above all the other three tracks to make it prominent. Adjust the size of the cursor place it on the Subscribe button where you want it to appear.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button8.png"                      alt="subscribe-button8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Now, it’s time to animate the design using keyframes. First of all, let’s animate the red rectangle. Double click on the red color on the timeline. Go to the ‘Animation’ tab and then click ‘Customize.’ Move to the 1 second in the timeline and click ‘Add.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button9.png"                      alt="subscribe-button9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now go back to the beginning in the timeline and adjust the scale to 0%. It will make the rectangle pop up when you play the clip.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button10.png"                      alt="subscribe-button10"                ></p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Text needs to be animated as well to match it with the rectangle. Double click on the text in the timeline and click ‘ADVANCED.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button11.png"                      alt="subscribe-button11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 12:</strong> In this Advance text editor, go to the ‘Animation’ tab and select any animation that you like. On the timeline under the preview screen, adjusts the dark areas according to the time you set on the rectangle, which was 1 second. We want the text to appear on the screen in 1 second, like the rectangle. Also, adjust the ending time when you want the text to disappear again. We have set it on 4 seconds. Which means it will start to fade after 4 seconds.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button12.png"                      alt="subscribe-button12"                ></p><p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Now, to animate the mouse cursor, we will use the same process we used for a rectangle that is key framing. Double click on the cursor track on the timeline and move the time on your timeline to a point when you want the cursor to appear. Now add a key frame by clicking ‘Add’.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button13.png"                      alt="subscribe-button13"                ></p><p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Now jump back to a point in your timeline, when the cursor will start appearing from outside the screen. Move the cursor outside the screen from where you want it to start moving toward the subscribe animation.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button14.png"                      alt="subscribe-button14"                ></p><p><strong>Step 15:</strong> To animate the click of the cursor, move ahead a little bit into your timeline and scale down the cursor to around 70%. Move it a little further and scale it up to 100%.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button15.png"                      alt="subscribe-button15"                ></p><p><strong>Step 16:</strong> You can add the sound of mouse click to make it more realistic. You can find this sound anywhere on the internet. Download it and import it into Filmora.

Many newbies to videography, though, don’t think about this when they use their camera indoors and discover that their recorded footage appears too dark.</p><p>If you want to use your camera indoors as many YouTubers do, you’ll need to have extra light. But the solution is not as simple as surrounding yourself with lamps that are all randomly placed.</p><p>Below, I’ll go into detail on how you can set up your lighting equipment to make your YouTube videos look good.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Table of Contents <a href="#USING-LIGHT-YOU-ALREADY-HAVE">Using Light You Already Have</a> <a href="#Window-Lighting">Window Lighting</a><a href="#Home-Lighting">Home Lighting</a> <a href="#HOME-STUDIO-LIGHTING">Home Studio Lighting</a> <a href="#Light-Control">Light Control</a><a href="#Three-Point-Lighting">3-Point Lighting</a><a href="#four-point-lighting">4-Point Lighting</a></th></tr></thead></table><h2 id="Part-1-Using-Light-You-Already-Have"><a href="#Part-1-Using-Light-You-Already-Have" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Using Light You Already Have"></a>Part 1: Using Light You Already Have</h2><p>Most beginner YouTubers light their videos with what they already have. That’s what I did to start as well. In the past, my video recording space consisted of natural sunlight coming from my window and ceiling light for times when the sunlight wasn’t strong enough.</p><h3 id="1-Window-Lighting"><a href="#1-Window-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="1.  Window Lighting"></a>1.  Window Lighting</h3><p>The best thing about window lighting is that it’s free. The worst thing about it is that it’s uncontrollable. The amount of light you get in your video can vary with all the changes in the weather.</p><p>Window lighting for me was especially difficult to work with because I live in a very rainy and cloudy city, Vancouver, Canada, where we pretty much just get three months of good sun.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-lighting-comparison.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Video Lighting"                ></p><p>Above are two freeze frames from one of Daniel’s past window-lit vlogs. Although these two frames are both from the same vlog, you can see that the image on the right looks brighter due to clearer skies at that moment. These varying amounts of light is what you will have to deal with if you choose to light your YouTube video with window lighting.</p><h3 id="2-Home-Lighting"><a href="#2-Home-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. Home Lighting"></a>2. Home Lighting</h3><p>Home lighting is another source of light that many new YouTubers use. In the past, when my window light wasn’t strong enough to light my video recording space, I would turn on the ceiling light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/home-lighting-for-youtube-videos.jpg"                      alt="Mixed Lighting"                ></p><p>Notice how the color of Daniel’s skin looks much more orange here (above) than the color of the skin in the two side-by-side window lighting examples? The side of the face also appears to look bluer. This all happened because he mixed up different color temperatures shining out of the two lights (cooler window light and warmer ceiling light).</p><p>Most home lighting is warmer in its color temperature. If you want to use your home lights without everything being orange-tinted, you’ll need to switch out your light bulbs for daytime LED light bulbs.</p><p>Ceiling lights are also typically situated in the center of a room in order to light an entire room evenly. This is not likely to be the best location for your filming video. Since the ceiling light was directly above the face in the above example, you can see harder shadows beneath his cheeks.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Home-Studio-Lighting"><a href="#Part-2-Home-Studio-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Home Studio Lighting"></a>Part 2: Home Studio Lighting</h2><p>If you rather not deal with all the window and home lighting challenges, you can set up studio lighting in your home.</p><h3 id="1-Light-Control"><a href="#1-Light-Control" class="headerlink" title="1. Light Control"></a>1. Light Control</h3><p>The first thing you’ll want to do to set up studio lighting in your home is to pick a room to film in and eliminate as much external lighting as you can. Use blinds, curtains, towels, or any thick fabric to block sunlight from shining into your room.</p><h3 id="2-3-Point-Lighting"><a href="#2-3-Point-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. 3-Point Lighting"></a>2. 3-Point Lighting</h3><p>The most common setup for studio lighting is 3-point lighting. For this kind of lighting you’ll need three lights: a key light, a fill light, and a back light (also called a hair light).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-lighting-3-point-lighting.jpg"                      alt="3-Point Lighting"                ></p><p>Out of the three lights, the key light should be the brightest. When it is positioned to the left of you (as shown in the diagram above) your right side will have shadows.</p><p>To minimize the shadows on your right side, use a weaker light as a fill light. You don’t want your fill light to completely eliminate all your shadows or else your shot will look flat.</p><p>Lastly, a backlight positioned behind you can give an appealing highlight to the ends of your head and even help to separate your hair from blending into your background if both happen to be dark.</p><h3 id="3-4-Point-Lighting"><a href="#3-4-Point-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="3. 4-Point Lighting"></a>3. 4-Point Lighting</h3><p>As a YouTuber, you may not only want yourself to be seen optimally with proper lighting, but you may also want your background to be seen optimally, especially if you’ve taken the time to decorate it for your audience.</p><p>What you’ll need to ensure that your background is sufficiently lit is 4-point lighting setup. The 4-point lighting setup is the same as a 3-point lighting setup, but with an additional light shining at your background.</p><p>For more information on lighting equipment, check out my <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-17-video-lighting-equipment-for-youtubers-440.html" >Top 17 Video Lighting Equipment For YouTubers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="Touch-Up-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Touch-Up-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Touch Up YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Touch Up YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best video editing software for YouTube beginners to start the YouTube channel.

After all, it lets us narrate our story via two (or more) screens and gives our audience a superior viewing experience. Though, a lot of users find it hard to implement the split-screen effect on YouTube videos. Here, I will let you know how to come up with all kinds of YouTube split-screen videos by using a professional video editor.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Diverse-Applications-of-Split-screen-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-The-Diverse-Applications-of-Split-screen-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Diverse Applications of Split-screen Videos"></a>Part 1: The Diverse Applications of Split-screen Videos</h2><p>Before we discuss how to work on YouTube split-screen videos, let’s quickly consider some major applications of this video effect.</p><ul><li><h3 id="To-draw-a-direct-comparison"><a href="#To-draw-a-direct-comparison" class="headerlink" title="To draw a direct comparison"></a>To draw a direct comparison</h3></li></ul><p>One of the most popular applications of split-screen videos is for comparing two or more instances or perspectives in the same frame. For example, you might wish to depict the lifestyle of two people from different parts of the world or simply compare the effect of various seasons in a single video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-1.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><ul><li><h3 id="To-provide-two-or-more-perspectives"><a href="#To-provide-two-or-more-perspectives" class="headerlink" title="To provide two or more perspectives"></a>To provide two or more perspectives</h3></li></ul><p>Videos are the best visual storytelling tools and just like any story, they can also have different perspectives. Ideally, the split-screen effect would be one of the best ways to show your audience all kinds of perspectives that can take place in your story.</p><p>One of the best examples was depicted in the movie “500 Days of Summer” in which we got several Expectations vs. Reality shots. These split-screen shots depicted the two major perspectives of the story in a single frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-2.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><ul><li><h3 id="To-implement-the-cloning-effect"><a href="#To-implement-the-cloning-effect" class="headerlink" title="To implement the cloning effect"></a>To implement the cloning effect</h3></li></ul><p>Have you ever wondered how filmmakers create a clone of a person in movies? To do that, we make the protagonist record both the scenes in front of the same background. Later, we implement a split-screen effect in which both the clips are combined in such a way that it makes the audience believe as if the scene has both, the character and their clone placed flawlessly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-3.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><h3 id="Watch-Video-Use-Split-Screen-for-Your-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Watch-Video-Use-Split-Screen-for-Your-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Watch Video!

To do this, just launch Wondershare Filmora on your system and click on the “Import” button to load your videos. You can also go to its <strong>Menu &gt; File &gt; Import Media</strong> to do the same.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/3.import-media-files.jpg"                      alt="import media file"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Select-the-Split-screen-Template-and-Add-Your-Videos"><a href="#Step-2-Select-the-Split-screen-Template-and-Add-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Select the Split-screen Template and Add Your Videos"></a>Step 2: Select the Split-screen Template and Add Your Videos</h3><p>Great!

Just click on it to browse a wide range of split-screen video templates for YouTube to include two, three, or more clips. You can just double-click any template to get its preview and drag-and-drop it to the timeline to start working on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora9-mac-apply-split-screen.jpg"                      alt="filmora split screen"                ></p><p>If you want, you can take the playhead and drag the pointer to adjust the length of the split-screen template on the timeline.

You can further go to its editing features and explore the “Video” tab to scale, reposition, or rotate your clips. There are also options to add borders in the split-screen effect to separate the clips distinctively in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/split-screen-video-editing-filmora9-mac.jpg"                      alt="filmora split screen"                ></p><p>Apart from that, you can also go to the “Color” section to access various color correction features.

I learned from those mistakes and have helped many new YouTubers start their own channels. Here is a list of eight common mistakes that new YouTubers should avoid, along with tips to do things in a better way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/mistakes-to-avoid-as-a-new-youtuber.jpg"                      alt="Mistakes To Avoid As a New YouTuber"                ></p><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><h3 id="1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision"><a href="#1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Failing to have a long-term vision"></a>1. Failing to have a long-term vision</h3><p>One common mistake that a lot of new YouTubers make is failing to have a long-term vision. Without a long-term vision, you’re more likely to poorly brand your YouTube channel, drop your YouTube channel activity in busier times, and, midway through, change the type of content you create and upload. None of these are good for your channel!</p><p>If you can think of the kind of content you’ll love to consistently create and share in the long-run, you’ll not only be able to narrow down your brand and effectively communicate to your audience who you are and what your channel is all about, but you’ll also have a better idea on what to put out next.</p><h3 id="2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL"><a href="#2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL"></a>2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL</h3><p>Another mistake I made with my first YouTube channel was choosing an ineffective custom URL. Because my last name is Kim, I wanted to make my custom URL “YouTube.com&#x2F;kimagination.” But it wasn’t available. So, I took “kimaginati0n” with a zero where the “o” should be. I thought it was a good idea back then but it was a terrible idea.</p><p>Choose a custom URL with words that can’t be confused with other similar-sounding words. For consistency across all your different social media accounts, try to choose a custom URL that matches the usernames of all your other social media channels. If the username you want isn’t available, then keep on trying to come up with a good name that is available. When you’ve secured the same username across all your different social media channels, you can then very simply promote yourself and all your social media channels by displaying just the social media icons followed by your one username.</p><h3 id="3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched"><a href="#3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched" class="headerlink" title="3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched"></a>3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched</h3><p>Many new YouTubers make the mistake of titling their videos in an ineffective way. Rather than coming up with titles that more people might search, they either come up with titles that summarize what the video is about as a whole or title their videos the way big YouTubers do.</p><p>Big YouTubers can take advantage of non-searched, curiosity evoking titles like “You won’t believe what just happened…” because they already have a huge following. Their channels aren’t depending on getting discovered through search. But yours is. So come up with titles that people are actually searching.</p><p>As an example, let’s suppose you vlogged your time backpacking around Europe last summer. Don’t title your YouTube video “My Summer Backpacking Trip.” Instead, title it “Going Up The Eiffel Tower | Beautiful View of Paris!” This way, all the people who are curious about visiting Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and seeing what the view is like from the top of the Eiffel Tower might find your video.</p><h3 id="4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy"><a href="#4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy" class="headerlink" title="4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy"></a>4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy</h3><p>New YouTubers tend to think about their thumbnail images after they’ve finished editing their videos together. This is way too late in the process for something that is so incredibly important in getting views.</p><p>Even before filming, you should think about how you’re going to title your video to get the most views. After that, you should then try to picture, in your head, a thumbnail image that matches your title and creates curiosity and excitement. When you go into filming, you can then make sure to include some footage of you recreating that image.</p><h3 id="5-Making-weak-intros"><a href="#5-Making-weak-intros" class="headerlink" title="5. Making weak intros"></a>5. Making weak intros</h3><p>After you’ve managed to get someone to click on your video through your effective title and thumbnail image strategy, the next challenge is to keep that person watching your video without closing it too early. A typical viewer on YouTube decides within the first ten to fifteen seconds of landing on a video whether or not he or she will stay or leave. This short window of time is so important to set the tone of the rest of your video and build excitement and curiosity in your viewer with an effective, high-energy intro.</p><p>New YouTubers often make the mistake of having weak intros. Starting at the beginning of a story makes sense, right? The beginning, however, is not always the most exciting. Consequently, new YouTubers lose their audience’s attention too early on.</p><p>To read more on how some of the most successful YouTubers effectively do their intros, check out my blogpost on “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How To Edit YouTube Videos Like a YouTuber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.”</p><h3 id="6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers"><a href="#6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers"></a>6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers</h3><p>An important thing to do as a new YouTuber is engaging with your subscribers. Some new YouTubers, though, are so focused and busy with the production side of things that they forget to do the community side of things, including responding to comments. By not responding to comments as a new YouTuber, you hurt your potential to get more comments consistently from your subscribers. If your video’s comments section is very active, YouTube ranks your video higher in the videos it recommends to viewers.</p><p>Connecting with your audience shouldn’t just be limited to YouTube either. Use your other social media channels to connect with your audience as well.</p><h3 id="7-Not-promoting-with-social-media"><a href="#7-Not-promoting-with-social-media" class="headerlink" title="7. Not promoting with social media"></a>7. Not promoting with social media</h3><p>YouTube isn’t the only social media platform that people are spending their time on. People are spending their time on all kinds of different social media platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The more content in all of these platforms that you create to promote your video, the more potential your video has to be seen by their users.</p><p>New YouTubers sometimes forget to promote their videos and channel using other social media platforms. Consequently, they miss out on the opportunity to get views from multiple sources of social media.</p><h3 id="8-Spamming-comments"><a href="#8-Spamming-comments" class="headerlink" title="8. Spamming comments"></a>8. Spamming comments</h3><p>Commenting on other YouTube videos is another way to get your channel discovered from people reading over comments. If your profile picture and comment appears interesting enough, out of curiosity, people just might click your username to have a look at your channel.</p><p>But rather than leaving interesting comments that are related to the video, rather than adding to the conversation, some new YouTubers desperate to get more subscribers make the mistake of spamming videos with “check out my YouTube channel!” comments.</p><p>Spam comments annoy YouTubers. It would be much more beneficial to your channel to build good relationships with other YouTubers to possibly collaborate on a video together in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-todays-biggest-bites-the-top-youtube-hits/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Today’s Biggest Bites  The Top YouTube Hits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/egies-for-adequate-lighting-in-youtube-videos/"><u>Strategies for Adequate Lighting in YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-get-both-sides-right-expert-tips-on-crafting-compelling-pov-based-youtube-reaction-videos-2-pov-perspective/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Get Both Sides Right – Expert Tips on Crafting Compelling POV-Based YouTube Reaction Videos (2 POV Perspective)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/n-2024-exploring-the-disparities-between-youtube-and-dailymention/"><u>[New] In 2024, Exploring the Disparities Between YouTube and DailyMention</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ecrets-to-successful-backlink-generation-in-youtube-channels/"><u>[New] Secrets to Successful Backlink Generation in YouTube Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-ultimate-guide-prime-video-stabilizers/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Guide  Prime Video Stabilizers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/orm-picker-optimal-content-on-youtube-or-tiktok/"><u>Platform Picker  Optimal Content on Youtube or TikTok?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/approved-how-does-youtube-count-views-its-not-as-simple-as-you-think/"><u>2024 Approved  How Does YouTube Count Views?

Yoga instructors would visit studios after studios to instruct the practitioners. But the time has changed now. Most practitioners now practice yoga from home and so do the instructors. Here are a few tips on how to start your own yoga channel on YouTube.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Set-your-target-audience"><a href="#Tip-1-Set-your-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1. Set your target audience"></a>Tip 1. Set your target audience</h3><p>There are different levels of yoga practitioners as well as their lifestyle. A working mom may give you 10 minutes from her morning routine while a college-going student can give you 10 minutes in the afternoon. Hence, first you need to set your target audience and create your content based on that.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Upload-videos-as-scheduled"><a href="#Tip-2-Upload-videos-as-scheduled" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2. Upload videos as scheduled"></a>Tip 2. Upload videos as scheduled</h3><p>As you are instructing yoga through your YouTube channel, you need to keep your audience updated. A good way to keep them updated is creating a schedule to upload videos on a regular basis. You can also post the schedule on the description of your channel so that your audience waits for the next.</p><h3 id="Tip-3-Brand-the-practice"><a href="#Tip-3-Brand-the-practice" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Brand the practice"></a>Tip 3. Brand the practice</h3><p>Creating a brand out of yoga practicing is the next thing you can do. When people hear the name of your YouTube channel, they value it for its brand. Make it just like this. It can be under your name or your studio’s name. Nevertheless, it should propose a brand value.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Rank-on-SEO"><a href="#Tip-4-Rank-on-SEO" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4. Rank on SEO"></a>Tip 4. Rank on SEO</h3><p>The present era is full of competition. If you cannot rank among the top ones, you cannot actually get to the audience and make a business out of it. Hence, you should learn to rank on search engine optimization so that people interested in yoga get to your first.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Proper-video-editing"><a href="#Tip-5-Proper-video-editing" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5. Proper video editing"></a>Tip 5. Proper video editing</h3><p>Promoting your content through videos on YouTube channel is not like doing it in person.

These are short, vertical videos that are 60 seconds long. Originally a way of YouTube attempting to compete with TikTok, Shorts have become a household name. However, are YouTube shorts monetized? Can you get paid for YouTube shorts? The increasing interest in monetizing Shorts has inspired many creators working on their video creation. This article answers the question of <strong>can YouTube Shorts be monetized</strong> and explains how the revenue-sharing model works.</p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts Editor</strong> A cross-platform helps creators edit the vertical videos quickly and easily<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"                      alt="Free Download"                > <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Unveiling-the-Mystery-of-YouTube-Shorts-Revenue-Sharing"><a href="#Part-1-Unveiling-the-Mystery-of-YouTube-Shorts-Revenue-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The attention span of an average person who watches videos online is rather limited, which means that you, as a YouTube video creator, have only a small window of opportunity to captivate their attention. A 3D intro can be just the thing you need to set the tone for an entire video, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best intro makers you can use on your PC or Mac computers, online or on your Smartphones.</p><h2 id="The-5-Best-3D-Intro-Makers-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#The-5-Best-3D-Intro-Makers-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos"></a>The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Creating 3D animations from scratch is far from easy since you are going to need to be familiar with both the animation techniques and the animation software you’re using to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos. That’s why some of the intro makers, we included in this article, offer customizable templates that enable you to create stunning intros for your videos with ease. So, let’s get started.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/learn-gaming-video-editing-skills-banner.png" >Wondershare Filmstock Gaming Video Editing Skils <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-game?source_channel=seo_article&spm=rs.filmora_web" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-game?source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle&amp;spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h4 id="1-Panzoid"><a href="#1-Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="1. Panzoid"></a>1. Panzoid</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Web-based</p><p>This is an online platform that features hundreds of templates created by the platform’s users. Some of these templates are free to use, while some creators ask for a credit if you want to open your video with their intro. Each of the templates can be customized in accordance with the demands of your project from the platform’s Clipmaker, and you can even create your own account where you can save all your projects. After you’ve selected an intro you like, you can pick a new environment, insert new text and change its font, size or appearance, among other things. You can also adjust the Position, Rotation or Shake options in the Camera menu, and you can upload your own music, apply the fade in and fade out sound effects or adjust the sound volume from the Audio tab. When done, you should head over to the Download menu where you choose the Render Mode, and the format of the file you’re rendering before you save a watermark-free video to your computer.</p><h4 id="2-Blender"><a href="#2-Blender" class="headerlink" title="2. Blender"></a>2. Blender</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, Windows, macOS</p><p>Creating visual effects, tracking objects or making 3D intros for your YouTube videos are just a few, among numerous things you can do with Blender. This is an open source software, which means that anyone who is skillful enough can become a contributor. Moreover, you can develop the tools and add-ons on your own and customize the interface in virtually any way you want. Nonetheless, you must be a proficient 3D modeler and animator in order to be able to use Blender to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos, as the tools the software offers can be overwhelming for inexperienced users. On the other hand, Blender may be one of the best 3D creation suites around, so if you have plenty of experience with modeling, animation, compositing or motion tracking you should try creating 3D intros with this powerful software.</p><h4 id="3-Renderforest"><a href="#3-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="3. Renderforest"></a>3. Renderforest</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, subscription plans start at $9,99 for a single export</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> web-based</p><p>You can use Renderforest for much more than just making intros, as the platform offers the tools for logo creation, video editing, and website design. The platform also contains a huge intro the collection you can use free of charge. What’s more, you can customize each intro by changing the text, adjusting its colors or adding a voice-over. Renderforest lets you use its music library to create a soundtrack for the intro, or you can upload your own music from a computer and add it to the intro you’re making. Downloading the intros and all other videos you make with Renderforest is not possible unless you create an account. In addition, all the visual content you produce with the free version of Renderforest is going to be watermarked and in relatively poor resolution, which is why you have to select a subscription plan that allows you to get rid of the watermark and download videos in high-resolution.</p><h4 id="4-MotionDen"><a href="#4-MotionDen" class="headerlink" title="4. MotionDen"></a>4. MotionDen</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, subscription plans start at $9,00</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> web-based</p><p>Making 2D animations, birthday videos, commercials, logo animations or 3D intros for YouTube videos on the MotionDen platform is easy.

Keep in mind that you can only edit and download one intro for free and that you must choose a subscription plan in order to be able to fully customize the 3D YouTube intro you’ve selected and download it to your computer without a watermark. MotionDen is a great source of material for all YouTube content creators who don’t want to spend a lot of time creating 3D intros from scratch and would rather quickly customize a template before adding it to their project.</p><h4 id="5-Intro-Maker-for-YouTube"><a href="#5-Intro-Maker-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="5.

One of these leaps is the use of the <strong>chroma key background</strong>, which most people know by the more colloquial term—green screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/a-quick-guide-to-chroma-key-background-1.jpg"                      alt="clipper in front of green screen"                ></p><p>Chroma key, also known as green screen or blue screen, is a cool hack for seamless visual storytelling, allowing content creators to replace backgrounds with any image or video they want.

This process typically follows a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Background Selection:</li></ul><p>A solid, single-color background, often green or blue, that contrasts well with the subject must be used. The color chosen should not be present in the subject or any props in the camera field to avoid unintentional transparency.</p><ul><li>Color Keying:</li></ul><p>This requires the use of specialized visual effects software to key out the chosen color. The green or blue background is designated as transparent, making everything of that color see-through. The software distinguishes between the keyed color and the subject, creating a mask for the transparent areas.</p><ul><li>Foreground Filming:</li></ul><p>This involves filming the subject against the <strong>live chroma key background</strong>. During filming, the chosen background color (green or blue) won’t appear in the final result due to its transparency. The subject is captured as if separately from the isolated background.</p><ul><li>Post-Processing:</li></ul><p>In post-production processing, the editor takes the keyed-out color and replaces it with the new background of their choice. This step creates the illusion that the subject is in a different setting or environment. The transparent areas become filled with the chosen background which, if done right, results in a cohesive and visually appealing composition.</p><h2 id="Why-Green"><a href="#Why-Green" class="headerlink" title="Why Green?"></a>Why Green?</h2><p>Theoretically, the <strong>chroma key background</strong> can be any solid color. However, the most commonly used colors are studio blue and bright green, with the latter far more common.</p><p>The choice of background color depends on the specific requirements of the production and the colors present in the scenes being filmed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Contrast</p><p>The less similar your chosen background color is to natural skin tones, the easier to isolate and replace in your footage. Bright green provides a strong contrast to most human skin tones and is less likely to be present in costumes or natural surroundings, making it easier to isolate subjects during the color separation.</p><p>Luminance</p><p> The color green emits light with greater intensity than blue, allowing for far more effective isolation by cameras during filming. This also means that blue screens demand increased lighting for proper exposure compared to green. This situation may be less than ideal if you lack powerful lighting or you don’t have the big bucks for them.</p><p>Digital Sensors</p><p> Many digital cameras and sensors are more sensitive to green wavelengths, resulting in cleaner and more accurate color keying during post-processing. Modern technology has also evolved to optimize for a green background, making it a more practical choice for the chroma key effect.</p><p>Wardrobe and Set Design</p><p>Bright green occurs less naturally in costumes and set designs than other colors, making green the optimal choice for reducing the likelihood of color spill and keying issues. However, if you know your scene will have lots of green, it is probably best to film with a blue screen, so there’s less risk of color spill and less post-production work.</p><h2 id="Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio"><a href="#Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio"></a>Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio</h2><p>Setting up your chroma key is convenient and straightforward, but there are some key factors to consider while setting up to ensure maximal performance.</p><p>Choosing the Right Background Color</p><p>The first step in the chroma key setup is selecting the right background color to be keyed out. This choice determines your effective color separation and ensures a smooth keying process during editing. Choosing a chroma-key background color that contrasts distinctly with the subject’s colors is essential for effective color separation. This prevents unintentional transparency, color spill, and ensures a polished final result.</p><p>Lighting Considerations</p><p>Lighting is an important part of the chroma-keying process. Bold, uniform, and consistent lighting on both the subject and the background makes it easy to delineate one from the other fully. This minimizes shadows and variations in color, creating a smooth and seamless keying process. Multiple diffuse lights from different angles are often used to illuminate the green screen evenly.</p><p>Positioning&#x2F;Camera</p><p>Proper subject and camera placement are necessary to ensure an even color-keying process during post-production. To prevent shadow interference, the green screen should be smooth, tense, and without wrinkles or shadows.</p><p>High-quality cameras are essential every time, especially for chroma keying. Images with better definition are easier to key, so camera quality significantly affects the outcome. Even if your camera isn’t the best, merely shooting well can ensure a clean color-keying process during editing, resulting in professional-looking visuals.</p><h2 id="Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key"><a href="#Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key" class="headerlink" title="Recording Tips for Chroma Key"></a>Recording Tips for Chroma Key</h2><ul><li>Proper Lighting</li></ul><p>Maintaining uniform and well-defined lighting during recording is essential for a successful chroma-keying process. This consistency ensures a seamless keying process during post-production.</p><ul><li>Keep Distance from the Green Screen</li></ul><p>The optimal distance between the subject and the green screen minimizes color spill and allows for natural movements. Proper distance between subject and background allows for easier isolation of the background and much smoother post-editing. A recommended starting point for the issue is around 6 to 10 feet from the background.</p><ul><li>Subjects and Clothing</li></ul><p>As mentioned before, the choice of costume for Selecting appropriate clothing that doesn’t match the chroma key color prevents transparency issues. Subjects also have to be positioned in such a way that there is minimal light interference and reflection. These contribute to a flawless chroma key outcome.</p><h2 id="3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies"><a href="#3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies"></a>3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies</h2><ul><li>Color Spill</li></ul><p>Sometimes, reflected light from your green background can be cast on your subject and may remain so when the background light is keyed out. This phenomenon is known as a color spill. It is usually because of uneven lighting or shooting around reflecting surfaces. Avoiding spill can differentiate between good and lousy chroma key aftereffects.</p><p>Human hair is one area where color spill can show up unsuspectingly. Due to the translucency of hair, it is common for some unintended light to seep through. This allows some background visibility, which you do not want with a chroma key. This is especially notable with lighter hair colors like blond hair.</p><p>There are ways to account for this. Many video-editing software have features such as spill suppression and screen matte adjustments that can enhance the final footage. Specialized plugins also go a long way in ensuring minimizing spill. Addressing spill correction tackles unwanted green artifacts and ensures a clean keying process.</p><ul><li>Poor Lighting</li></ul><p>Suboptimal green screen lighting can lead to inconsistencies in keying and editing, undermining your product. One way to avoid this is to light the screen and subject separately. Another tip, although expensive, is using multiple diffuse light sources and trying to maintain even lighting across every square foot of your scene. Super bright or dark spots can ruin your output, so it’s worth the extra effort if you don’t want to deal with problematic post-production.</p><ul><li>Poorly Refined Edges</li></ul><p>Chroma keying should leave your videos with crisp, defined, natural-looking edges. But post-production editing can make all the difference if it doesn’t come out to your taste. Softening and refining edges make a smoother transition between the foreground object and the new background. Light adjustments to edge thickness and screen matte settings can also help enhance overall visual quality and add finesse to your work.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Green screen photography produces excellent results, and its ease of use makes it indispensable for videographers of all levels.

It’s hard to crack the top search engine rankings as a small channel. Many people on YouTube would probably love their content, but all of those views are going to already popular channels.</p><p>Many YouTubers look for alternative ways to get views for their videos, not to replace organic views, but to better position their videos to be seen by real viewers. Buying views or signing up for a view exchange platform are two methods some YouTubers consider, and another is bots.</p><p><strong>View exchange platforms are allowed, and buying views is grey, but bots are against the rules. Warning:</strong> be aware that increasing your view count with a bot is against YouTube’s Terms of Service and that if you get caught, your video will be taken down. If you still wish to learn more about bots, keep reading. If you want safer options, scroll down to ‘Alternatives to Bots.’</p><p><a href="#what_is_view_bot">What is a YouTube view bot?</a></p><p><a href="#why">Why use a YouTube view bot?</a></p><p><a href="#whatelse">What else can a YouTube view bot do?</a></p><p><a href="#risks">Are there risks to using a YouTube view bot?</a></p><p><a href="#alternatives">Alternatives to YouTube view bots</a></p><h2 id="What-Is-A-YouTube-View-Bot"><a href="#What-Is-A-YouTube-View-Bot" class="headerlink" title="What Is A YouTube View Bot?"></a>What Is A YouTube View Bot?</h2><p>Bots work in an automated sense, just like software, and they can run in the background. Bots automatically add views to your videos.</p><p>Setting up a bot can be as easy as using other pieces of software, and there are lots of free tutorials on YouTube for view bots.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-a-YouTube-View-Bot"><a href="#Why-Use-a-YouTube-View-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Why Use a YouTube View Bot?"></a>Why Use a YouTube View Bot?</h2><p>Bots are used to create the illusion that a video is already popular to attract real viewers who view the existing view count as ‘social proof’ of the video’s quality. The main benefit is that it is fast, easy, and usually free. There are other ways, besides bots, bot accomplishes this, but if a YouTuber is resorting to a bot, it probably means they don’t have the money to buy real human views or the time to participate in a view exchange platform.</p><p>Bots can also be used to generate comments and likes for videos.</p><h2 id="What-Else-Can-A-YouTube-View-Bot-Do"><a href="#What-Else-Can-A-YouTube-View-Bot-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?"></a>What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?</h2><p>The most effective bots come with more features than bypassing Captchas and generating views.</p><p>You can set up a YouTube bot to perform daily tasks and automate your workflow. An example might be ensuring that every video on your page gets a view and comment every day. You can also use bots (or content organization platforms) to share your videos across social media automatically. This frees you up to focus on creating quality content.</p><p>Using a bot to increase your views artificially has its dangers, but it also has the potential to kick start the organic growth of your channel. Once you start attracting real viewers and subscribers, you will not need to keep relying on a bot.</p><h2 id="Are-There-Risks-to-Using-A-YouTube-View-Bot"><a href="#Are-There-Risks-to-Using-A-YouTube-View-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?"></a>Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?</h2><p> <strong>Yes.</strong></p><p>Bots are against YouTube’s TOS, especially for partners using AdSense (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube’s partnership program here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Suppose you are suspected of using a bot. In that case, your videos can get taken down, and you could lose the ability to monetize content (YouTube reviews channels now before they can monetize, and it will be obvious to them if you’ve used a bot to get to the 10,000 lifetime views you need for monetization). Repeated offenses could even get you banned from YouTube, and it is much easier to lose AdSense access.</p><p>The biggest danger isn’t YouTube taking your videos down, though. So long as you don’t persist after being warned, you can always recover. No, the real danger of bots is that they generate low retention views. Essentially, the views you get from a bot appear to YouTube’s algorithm as if people have clicked on your videos but haven’t watched them. The algorithm interprets that as ‘the people clicking on this don’t like it, we should rank it lower down in search results. Rather than attracting organic views, bots can make it very difficult for a real viewer to find your content.</p><p>If you are going to use a bot, you need to use it smartly and sparingly to prevent damage to your channel.</p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-Using-View-Bots-to-Increase-YouTube-Views"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Using-View-Bots-to-Increase-YouTube-Views" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Using View Bots to Increase YouTube Views"></a>Alternatives to Using View Bots to Increase YouTube Views</h2><h3 id="1-Organically-Growing-Your-Channel"><a href="#1-Organically-Growing-Your-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1.

There can be some perks to using them - we won’t deny that there are people who have benefitted from bots through a mixture of luck and careful strategy - but in general, it is better to focus your efforts on <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-better-youtube-videos--278.html" >your content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/14-tactics-that-actually-work%21-how-to-gain-more-subscribers-300.html" >solid YouTube strategies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="2-View2-be"><a href="#2-View2-be" class="headerlink" title="2.

The company will deliver a series of free subscription, engagement, and view packages. In most cases, this is a traffic exchange service (you must participate by watching other people’s videos) until you get into the premium and affiliate services. In these cases, users can advertise the services of View2be to get access to more views and subscriptions. The premium services are just a straight charge for a total number of views, subscribers, or other items.</p><h3 id="3-UltraViews"><a href="#3-UltraViews" class="headerlink" title="3. UltraViews"></a>3. UltraViews</h3><p>UltraViewers is another traffic exchange service in which people can trade traffic to get more views on their webpages or YouTube videos. This site requires you to open your browser and automatically navigate to a number of websites. You will be rewarded with new hits to your videos based on the number of websites you visit. This is a fairly simple system. There is also a lottery where you can win extra hits.</p><h3 id="4-My-Social-Following"><a href="#4-My-Social-Following" class="headerlink" title="4. My Social Following"></a>4. My Social Following</h3><p>My Social Following is a source for YouTube viewers, subscribers, and likes. As a professional marketing service, the company allows for various benefits such as location targeted services, fast deliveries, improvements in the ranking, and (most importantly)real viewers watching your YouTube videos in full to boost your retention rates and search engine rankings.</p><p>If you are truly serious about earning free views, YouTube view bots are one of many options, but they do mean accepting whatever consequences YouTube might hand down.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload
