However, there are occasions where you need to be able to make these adjustments. Are the videos you take inside at night at a lower quality than the ones you record during the day, for example? If you could set a higher ISO, you would be able to fix that.</p><p>Another example: just the other day, there was a question here about shooting green screen videos on a mobile device. One of our community members, Vivekpanwar, was having an issue with motion blur. Motion blur isn’t always distracting in normal videos, but it becomes a huge issue when you apply a Chroma key effect. The best way to avoid motion blur is to set a high shutter speed, which you can do if you download a quality <strong>camera app</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-how-to-completely-erase-youtube-shorts-footprint-for-2024/"><u>[New] How To Completely Erase YouTube Shorts Footprint for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/n-2024-digital-diving-into-youtubes-veiled-video-vaults/"><u>[New] In 2024, Digital Diving Into YouTube’s Veiled Video Vaults</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-shape-your-story-5-proven-techniques-for-cutting-and-condensing-vimeo-videos-online-for-2024/"><u>[New] Shape Your Story 5 Proven Techniques for Cutting & Condensing Vimeo Videos Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/treamline-your-online-listening-experience-with-direct-capture-for-2024/"><u>[New] Streamline Your Online Listening Experience with Direct Capture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/riting-for-impact-a-compreenas-guide-to-youtube-video-storytelling-for-2024/"><u>[New] Writing for Impact A Compreenas Guide to YouTube Video Storytelling for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-iphone-silhouette-photography-tips/"><u>2024 Approved IPhone Silhouette Photography Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/childhood-to-cash-flow-young-kajis-youtube-economic-surge-for-2024/"><u>From Childhood to Cash Flow Young Kaji’s YouTube Economic Surge for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-microsoft-store-error-0x800704cf-in-windows-11-and-11/"><u>How to Fix the Microsoft Store Error 0X800704CF in Windows 11 & 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-mirror-pc-screen-to-vivo-s17e-phones-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Mirror PC Screen to Vivo S17e Phones? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/perfect-timeline-control-with-top-20-tweet-management-apps-for-2024/"><u>Perfect Timeline Control with Top 20 Tweet Management Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/pro-audio-integration-essential-tips-for-podcasters-for-2024/"><u>Pro Audio Integration Essential Tips for Podcasters for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/1723011085197-resolve-oculus-link-problems-quickly-with-these-proven-6-fixes/"><u>Resolve Oculus Link Problems Quickly with These Proven 6 Fixes!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/strategic-utilization-of-azure-voice-to-text-capabilities/"><u>Strategic Utilization of Azure Voice-to-Text Capabilities</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s by this that those who are interested in your video get hooked to them.</p><p>For tags to work ideally, you need to include your brand-specific tags before adding similar tags. YouTube auto-suggest is another gem in this scenario. Just see what YouTube suggests when you type while searching other similar topics. For great results, place the most important keywords and tags first, as these will act as the face of your video.</p><h2 id="How-will-YouTube-tag-affect-your-video-performance"><a href="#How-will-YouTube-tag-affect-your-video-performance" class="headerlink" title="How will YouTube tag affect your video performance?"></a>How will YouTube tag affect your video performance?</h2><p>It is YouTube tags that help viewers to find videos they are searching for on YouTube.

Periscope can easily make your streams more attractive with its appealing live stream engagements.</p><p> As, millions of users are already connected to Twitter and enjoying interactive talks with world over there so most of these prefer to chose Periscope as one of the most trustworthy platform for Live streaming.</p><h3 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h3><ul><li>It offers wide range of settings and functions.</li><li>Twitter has recently added 360 video ability to Periscope.</li><li>Well designed with user friendly interface.</li><li>More number of subscribers can be easily connected.</li></ul><h3 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h3><ul><li>Infrequent updates are issue for professional streamers.</li></ul><h2 id="Facebook-Live-Vs-YouTube-Live-Vs-Periscope-What’s-the-Difference"><a href="#Facebook-Live-Vs-YouTube-Live-Vs-Periscope-What’s-the-Difference" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Live Vs. YouTube Live Vs. Periscope: What’s the Difference?"></a>Facebook Live Vs. YouTube Live Vs. Periscope: What’s the Difference?</h2><p><strong>1. Audience:</strong></p><p> We all know that Facebook is currently having highest user base so naturally Facebook Live is assumed to have more viewers and streamers. Google considers most of the YouTube content valuable but note that it is YouTube not the recently updated YouTube Live platform. On the other side, if we talk about Periscope then it can be best described as a standalone network. In case if it gets linked to main app YouTube then it may avail some popularity in the market, same as that of Facebook. If you are a beginner then probably, Facebook is the best choice for you as it can provide more audience over the nights. Periscope users can also enjoy healthy content over Mobile phones with great stream quality. One more interesting thing to know about Periscope is that it can be used to develop healthy relationships with so many viewers and followers.</p><p><strong>2. User Interface:</strong></p><p> Here is one more interesting factor to discuss about all these amazing Live streaming platforms. This feature makes a system or software standout among other competitors. If we compare user interface of Facebook Live, Periscope and YouTube Live then you will find them all almost similar. But most of the beginners rate Facebook as most simple and user friendly tool for live broadcasts. Second rating is received by Periscope whereas YouTube Live stands on third level. User interface of Periscope and Facebook live possesses so many similar features such as ability to subscribe, comment or updating likes etc.</p><p><strong>3. Saving Broadcasts and Embedding Replays:</strong></p><p> Let us discuss about saving broadcasts as well as get some idea about their ability to arrange embedding replays. The video archiving ability of YouTube and Facebook is having almost similar kind of features. Users are able to update their live streams and they can also be saved for longer run, even permanently as per need. If you want to delete them then simple controls allow easy removal of updated broadcasts from channel. On the other side, Periscope allows live streamers to stay on channel only for 24 hours. After that, all the updated videos get automatically deleted. On Facebook, users cannot come to know about who is watching their live streams until and unless they receive comments from viewers. Although, Facebook keep on updating notifications about all live streams but more often they create a bug. In case of Periscope, whenever a person starts viewing your uploaded content, his name will directly appear at your end. It can help you to know the real strength of your updates so that you can improve quality of content as per interest of viewers. It is also possible to make private or public settings for broadcasts on Periscope whereas Facebook is gaining more popularity for its Split Screen and 360 videos.</p><p><strong>4. Interaction:</strong></p><p><strong>Communicate with Broadcasters:</strong></p><p> If you want to interact with broadcaster on Facebook then you can simply update your comment or show them your reaction with emojies. They can be updated at the time of live broadcasts as well as at the time of replay. Most of the Facebook users are unhappy with its lag time as broadcasters comment gets published after a delay of 30 seconds. In case of Periscope, viewers are able to just comment on live broadcasts and they can also update a heart for their favourite content. If we compare the lag time of Facebook and Periscope then it is lower for Periscope and people often enjoy instantaneous conversations over this network. The best part is that Viewers can update numbers of hearts even for single broadcast and all of them will get recorded. This feature is not available with Facebook emojies. You will be glad to know that once you have prepared account over YouTube then same details can be used to access Periscope platform.</p><p><strong>Interaction with Viewers:</strong></p><p> Facebook allows broadcasters and viewers to enjoy healthy communication as here talks can be initiated by updating name of the person before writing comment. If you want to communicate with all viewers in more professional manner then Facebook’s name based comment updates are best choices. Note that, facebook allows users to enjoy communicate even when stream has already ended. In case of Periscope, again viewers and broadcasters can enjoy direct name to name comment based conversations. Periscope broadcasts can also be enjoyed on Twitter platform directly but here you cannot update hearts directly. Also, comments remains dedicated to Twitter and Periscope environment. YouTube Live allows users to share their viewing experiences with comments and it helps broadcasters to get feedbacks for improvement. Content from YouTube Live can also be shared on other platforms.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload

AI-based features are also available here for quick automated edits (Instant Mode), removing background by focusing on only the subject (AI Portrait), and more.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-Filmora-to-create-engaging-videos-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#How-to-use-Filmora-to-create-engaging-videos-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="How to use Filmora to create engaging videos for YouTube?"></a>How to use Filmora to create engaging videos for YouTube?</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Step1 Download and launch the Filmora software on Mac or Windows PC.</p><p>Step2 Tap on New Project &gt; Click here to import media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/ryan-kajis-net-worth-11-year-old-boy-gets-highest-paid-from-youtube-2022-7.jpg"                      alt="click here to import media"                ></p><p>Step3 After choosing the video file or files from your device, drag them to the editor timeline below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/ryan-kajis-net-worth-11-year-old-boy-gets-highest-paid-from-youtube-2022-8.jpg"                      alt="drag video to editor timeline"                ></p><p>Step4 From the toolbar just above the timeline, click on the standard functions you want to use for editing the video.

You could argue that Samsung has impressive sales and is almost at par with Apple but in regards to sheer dominance or superiority, the South Korea based conglomerate bows down to the American tech juggernaut. YouTube is indisputably the most popular video hosting and sharing site in the world. It doesn’t help that YouTube is owned by Google, the search engine giant that also owns Android which powers all popular Samsung smartphones at the moment. As a result, what you get is a tad incompatible with YouTube and iPhone or iPad. Downloading YouTube videos is very simple if you are using an Android smartphone or a Windows computer. It is not so when you are using an iPhone, iPad or even a Mac.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >iPhone Video Downloaders &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Fortunately, there are ways you can download YouTube videos to iPhone or iPad, and we aren’t talking about YouTube’s promise of offline video streaming. Here is a complete guide.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos&#x2F;audio materials from your own channel.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h3 id="First-you-need-a-video-downloader"><a href="#First-you-need-a-video-downloader" class="headerlink" title="First, you need a video downloader"></a>First, you need a video downloader</h3><p>You need a third party app which is approved by Apple and available in App Store. There are quite a few free video downloader apps that you can check. But do make sure that the app is active or usable right now. Apple is a tad infamous for deleting some of the apps from its store from time to time. If that happens after you have installed and started using a video downloader, then you can just remove it and opt for another. Most of these free video downloader apps will save your videos within the app. Some would add them to the videos in your Camera Roll. You can use AirPlay to watch the videos if you have an Apple TV. The videos saved by downloader apps will not be found in the native Videos app of iPhone or iPad. When you search for such apps, use ‘video downloader’ or ‘YouTube downloader’ as the keywords.</p><h3 id="Find-a-suitable-app-download-it-for-free-and-install-it"><a href="#Find-a-suitable-app-download-it-for-free-and-install-it" class="headerlink" title="Find a suitable app, download it for free and install it"></a>Find a suitable app, download it for free and install it</h3><p>Some of the downloader apps will have premium or pro versions. You don’t need to pay before you have used the free or basic version. Once installed, start the app. Most of these apps have a built-in browser which should allow you to access YouTube. In most cases, you would get to m.youtube.com. If there is no default address, then save the mobile version of YouTube as the default URL. On iPad, you can go for &lt;<a href="http://www.youtube.com>">www.youtube.com&gt;</a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977020">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977020.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977020">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977020.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977020%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977020/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Downloading-Youtube-videos-to-iPhone-or-iPad"><a href="#Downloading-Youtube-videos-to-iPhone-or-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Downloading Youtube videos to iPhone or iPad"></a>Downloading Youtube videos to iPhone or iPad</h3><p>In all likelihood, you are familiar with how YouTube works. Search for a video that you wish to download, pick the one you want from the search results and it would automatically start to play. In some cases, you may have to click the play button or tap on the video thumbnail for it to start playing. As the video begins to stream or buffer, you would find an icon of the app, usually bobbing or hovering over the screen playing the video. You can tap on this icon, which could be a disk sign or the logo of the app. As you tap on it, you would have a popup that will prompt you to download the video that you are watching.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-youtube-videos.jpg"                      alt="download youtube videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770544">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770544">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770544%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770544/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Depending on the app you are using, the download may begin immediately after tapping on the download icon or there can be another step, which will perhaps show you the list of downloading videos or videos that you have downloaded already. If the download doesn’t start immediately, there could be another button to initiate the download. Tap on it and you are done. The download would be automated and you don’t need to do anything else. You can also have your iPhone or iPad in sleep mode and the download would be completed, as long as there is an active internet connection. You can also see the progress made. Once the download or downloads are complete, you would get a notification.

Or, do you like to Livestream? These are two perks of having a YouTube account in good standing. You can lose these privileges, have your ability to post videos frozen, and even have your account terminated if you start accumulating strikes.</p><p>If you receive a strike, you will usually be able to get rid of it. This article will show you how.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><p><a href="#strikes">1. Copyright Strikes</a></p><p><a href="#wrong">2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</a></p><p><a href="#community">3. Community Guidelines Strikes</a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-strike.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Strike"                ></p><p> There are two types of strikes: <strong>Community Guideline Strikes</strong> and <strong>Copyright Strikes</strong>. Your account and all your videos will be deleted if you get three of either one of these types of strikes, but YouTube is fair about how these strikes are given out and how you can reverse them.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Copyright-Strikes"><a href="#1-Copyright-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Copyright Strikes"></a>1. Copyright Strikes</h2><p>You get a copyright strike when you use media in your video which someone else owns the copyrights to. Music, clips, photographs, and sound effects are examples of the kinds of media you may use that could be owned by someone else.</p><p>The most obvious way to earn a copyright strike is to repost content which you did not create, i.e. clips from a television show or a popular song. If you know that the content you got a strike for was not yours and did not fall under <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >‘fair use <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’, then there are two ways you can resolve it.</p><p>1. You can complete YouTube’s simple course on copyright infringement (<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/copyright%5Fschool" >Copyright School <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and wait three months. Copyright strikes expire in three months so long as you complete the course (they will not expire if you don’t take the course).</p><p>2. you can contact the holder of the copyright and ask them to retract their claim. You will probably have to offer to delete your video. Keep in mind that it is completely up to the rights holder whether you deleting your video is enough for them to retract their claim. They are allowed to say ‘no’.</p><p>Deleting your video, especially if you do so without contacting the rights holder, will not automatically reverse your copyright strike.</p><p>The majority of copyright strikes that you as a YouTube creator receive – if you receive any – will not be as black and white as ‘someone else owns it, you shouldn’t have used it’. If you know that you have a license to use the song or other media you got the strike for, or feel like your use of a clip falls under ‘fair use’, then your path to reversing the strike will be different.</p><h2 id="2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes"><a href="#2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes"></a>2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</h2><p>YouTube’s system for detecting copyright infringement is automated. This means that you can get a copyright strike without actually breaking any rules. These strikes are generally easy to reverse.</p><p>For creators, the most common instance of this is being flagged for using copyrighted music. When you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download royalty-free music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – whether you download it for free or pay for it – you might not realize that that music is still copyrighted to someone else and can still be flagged by YouTube’s system.</p><p>If this has happened to you, reversing it is simple.</p><p>1. Submit a counter-notification through the form provided and include either your licensing information or a link to where it can be found online.</p><p>2. After you submit your counter-notification, the copyright holder will have 10 business days to respond. Since in this scenario the rights holder will know they have allowed their content to be licensed out, there should be no conflict and your video will be reinstated.</p><p>‘Fair use’ is another thing YouTube’s system has no way of detecting. ‘Fair use’ means that you are using content that you do not own, and which you do not have a license to use, but that you are using it in a way that is legally protected. Satire, criticism, education, and news reporting are areas that may be protected by fair use, although every situation is different.</p><p>There is no situation in which crediting a rights holder, adding a disclaimer, or simply not monetizing your video will make it fair use.</p><p>To reverse a copyright strike where you believe your video should be protected as ‘fair use’, submit a counter-notification through the web form YouTube provides. The rights holder will have 10 business days to provide YouTube with evidence that they have initiated a court action against your content. There is a chance that they will not agree with you about the ‘fair use’ status of your video. You could be in for a bit of a fight.</p><p>If your account has been suspended for accumulating multiple strikes, you will no longer be able to access the online counter-notification form and will have to send a free-form counter-notification. <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6005919" >Information on that can be found here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997695/19272" target="_top" id="1997695">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997695" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997695/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes"><a href="#3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="3. Community Guidelines Strikes"></a>3. Community Guidelines Strikes</h2><p>Most video creators – people who post vlogs, travel videos, and various kinds of tutorials – will never receive this type of strike. Sexual content, hateful content, threats, and scams are among the things you could post which would result in a community guidelines strike. Creators, in general, are not interested in posting cruel or graphic content.</p><p>The only thing some video creators might have to be careful of is <strong>misleading metadata</strong>. You can get community guidelines to strike for intentionally using the title, tags, and description of your video to build up an expectation of the content your video does not deliver on. For example, if you post a personal vlog and title it ‘Call of Duty Review’ to try and capitalize on people who might be searching for gaming videos then you might receive a strike.</p><p>Blatantly using keywords that have nothing to do with your content is not something you can do accidentally, but it is possible to be misleading in your metadata without trying to be dishonest. YouTube is a very competitive place, and many creators are turning towards title strategies which could be considered ‘clickbait’. If you say in your title that you had a baby, but reveal in your actual video that ‘had a baby’ meant ‘wrote a new song’, will that get you a community guidelines strike? Probably not, but it can be a thin line.</p><p>In general, just don’t mention anything in your title or tags which you do not talk about in your video.</p><p>Community Guidelines strikes expire after three months. As long as you only have one strike, it will not affect your channel or what you can do on YouTube. If you receive a second strike within the three months of your first strike, you will lose the ability to post videos for two weeks. If you receive a third strike before either of your previous strikes has expired, your account will be terminated.</p><p> Have you experienced a copyright strike against your YouTube channel?

Of the major developments made in the recent past is the introduction of Shorts. These short vertical videos have grown in popularity as more people view videos on their phones. With this development, the <strong>YouTube Shorts fund</strong> was launched to reward creators for their efforts. The fund allows creators to monetize their Shorts quickly, supporting and incentivizing them to create high-quality Shorts content. In this article, we will explore the YouTube Shorts Fund 2023, including YouTube shorts fund eligibility.</p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts Monetization</strong> A cross-platform for taking your overexposed footage to cinema-quality Shorts video!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-YouTube-Shorts-Fund-Introduction-and-Benefits"><a href="#Part-1-YouTube-Shorts-Fund-Introduction-and-Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

YouTube Shorts Fund: Introduction and Benefits</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched YouTube Shorts Funds in 2021 to financially support creators who produce engaging and popular Shorts content. The monetization scheme would distribute $100 million to high-performing creators on the platform. The creators would receive high engagement and views from their Shorts for funding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-youtube-shorts-fund-1.jpeg"                      alt="youtube shorts fund"                ></p><p>The main objective of the YouTube Shorts fund is to encourage creativity, diversity, and innovation in Shorts content creation. The fund operated between 2021 and 2022. It lets creators earn $100 - $10,000 a month for their content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-youtube-shorts-fund-2.jpeg"                      alt="youtube shorts fund earnings"                ></p><p>Participating in YouTube Shorts Funds offer several benefits to the creators:</p><ul><li><strong>Additional Exposure:</strong> YouTube Shorts are predominately featured on the homepage, allowing creators to reach more people.</li><li><strong>Recognition:</strong> YouTube recognizes top Shorts creators through the Shorts Funding program, encouraging them to create more quality content.</li><li><strong>Potential Earnings</strong>: Creators can monetize their Shorts content in several ways including adding and other unique features.</li></ul><p>YouTube incorporated monetization of Shorts in its YouTube Partner Program (YPP). Therefore, YouTube merged the Shorts Fund with the YPP in February 2023. This led to YouTube Shorts Fund 2023 which now offers creators more opportunities to make money quickly on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Making-Money-with-YouTube-Shorts-Eligibility-and-Earnings"><a href="#Part-2-Making-Money-with-YouTube-Shorts-Eligibility-and-Earnings" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The revenue-sharing model has now taken the place of the YouTube Shorts Fund, which only rewarded creators using YouTube’s money. However, creators don’t have to be members of the YPP to start receiving YouTube Shorts funding.

Keep It Under 10 Seconds</strong></p><p>A 10-second intro should have lots of movement and exciting music to hold viewers’ attention. If your intro is more subdued then aim for more than 5 seconds.</p><p><strong>2. Support Your Brand</strong></p><p>One of the most important things your intro can do is strengthen your personal brand. Your intro should look related to your channel art and video thumbnails, but even beyond that, it should match the tone of your content.</p><p><strong>3. Use Music</strong></p><p>When there’s a silent pause in your video the chances of viewers clicking away increase. Make sure your intro includes music that suits the tone of your channel.</p><p><strong>4. Include Your Channel Name</strong></p><p>Your channel name should be a huge, prominent, visual in your intro. This may seem like a given, but there are intros out there where the channel name is either small easy to overlook, or left out completely in favor of a logo.</p><p><strong>5. Do a Cold Open</strong></p><p>On TV, shows usually have at least one scene before they play the theme song. That’s because nobody is tuning in just for the theme, or in your case the intro. Make sure you have at least a short clip before your intro to get viewers interested in the rest of your video. Beyond setting the tone for the rest of the video and introducing your topic, you can use this first clip to create a ‘curiosity gap’.
