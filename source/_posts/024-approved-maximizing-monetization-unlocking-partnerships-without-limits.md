Not just that, you must have a library of valuable content so that the potential sponsors can browse through several materials in your channel.

One is the discounting option where the code is shared and the viewers use these codes to get discounts anywhere between 5-15% in shopping products from that same site. Another option is to use the affiliate code to integrate it into an URL that offers profits to a content creator in form of traffic.
