## How to add a YouTube video to Google Slide

Use these two methods to add a YouTube video to Google Slides. Via the Search and Direct link.

#### Method 1\. Embed YouTube video to Google Slide by search and selection

Step 5\. Format your video. Remember that the entire video will be embedded. You don't necessarily need the whole video. It is time to select just a brief but relevant clip from the video to use.

#### Method 2\. Embed YouTube video to Google Slide by direct link

![add youtube video to google slides by direct link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-5.png)

Step 8\. Wait for the video file to load and press the "Select" option. The video will immediately appear in the presentation slide. Just drag and drop the video in your preferred position.

Note: You can do a few edits inside the application. Set the timer when your video should start and when to stop. You can also adjust the video player size.

## How to choose the right video for your Slides?

Not all videos will make an impact on your Google Slide. You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.

**Be Professional** – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.

**Relevant** – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.

**Precise** – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.

**Know every footage you are working with** – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.

**Add new content** – even though one content may suit several presentations, don't rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.

## How to choose the right video for your Slides?

Not all videos will make an impact on your Google Slide. You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.

**Be Professional** – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.

**Relevant** – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.

**Precise** – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.

**Know every footage you are working with** – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.

**Add new content** – even though one content may suit several presentations, don't rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.
