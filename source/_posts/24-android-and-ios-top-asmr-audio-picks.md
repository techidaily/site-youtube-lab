 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

An average person handles a lot of stress on a daily basis, whether at work, in traffic, or at home. We are all looking for ways to relax and to get our minds off the things that are stressing us out. ASMR videos have become a global trend that tends to do just that, provide relaxation, and help people deal with anxiety and depression.

Unaspiringly, there are hundreds of ASMR app that are compatible with iOS and Android devices you can use to relieve stress whenever you get a chance. We’ve selected some of the best ASMR apps for Android and iOS in order to help you find the one that best fits your needs.

## The Best Relaxation ASMR Apps for Android and iOS

The types of ASMR triggers the app offers, the diversity of its video selection or the quality of the audio are all important factors you will have to consider while choosing the ASMR app. Moreover, some apps enable you to customize the relaxing sounds that help you fall asleep. So, let's take a look at what the best relaxation ASMR apps for Android and iOS have to offer.

### 1\. [TeasEar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teasear-asmr-slime-simulator/id1439312630)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facemetrics.asmr&hl=en)

Textures can suite your nerves even if they are virtual. TeasEar enables you to simulate a more than a hundred slimy textures. Yogurt, Honey, or Confetti are just a few of the most popular textures you can experiment with, but there are many more available.

The app also lets you interact with each texture you generate, as you just have to place your fingers onto the surface of your Smartphone in order to produce the sound that can potentially trigger the ASMR.

However, the free version of the app grants you access to only a limited amount of triggers and you must purchase a weekly or monthly subscription in order to unlock all the triggers this app has to offer.

Finding ASMR content through the YouTube app is easy as there are so many different channels that produce videos that contain different types of ASMR triggers. On YouTube, you can find videos in which hosts are whispering into the microphone or tapping gently on it, as well as a broad range of videos that contain visual ASMR triggers. Although you can use the app for free, purchasing the YouTube Red or YouTube Premium will grant you access to a broader selection of ASMR videos.

The app’s modernly designed player makes it easy to save your favorite ASMR tracks to a playlist you can access in just a few taps. Moreover, Spotify’s algorithm recommends tracks based on the type of content you’re already listened to, which enables you to discover new ASMR recordings every day. The app is also equipped with a sleep timer so that you can doze off without having to worry if you are going to wake up on time. You’ll have to make an in-app purchase if you want to use Spotify’s premium features.

### 7\. [ASMRtist](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/asmrtist-asmr-sleep-sounds/id1265691013)

**Price:** Free

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crazylabs.asmr.cut&hl=en)

The sound of cutting through sand may be satisfying and trigger the AMSR. This app enables you to cut through different types of objects made from sand. The realistic simulation of the cutting process, the sounds created while cutting through objects make playing this video game incredibly fun.

Playing the ASMR Slicing game is certainly entertaining, as the relaxing sounds you’re making while cutting objects help you get rid of the stress. Even so, the app doesn’t really improve the quality of your sleep or assist you in overcoming anxiety or depression.

Preparing food is in itself a satisfying process that often enables us to forget about the daily troubles. ASMR Breakfast is a video game that simulates the process of preparing breakfast and challenges you to prepare a perfect meal.

The goal is to make a dish without wasting or spilling food, and once you accomplish this task you move onto the next more complicated dish. As you move on through the game you need to purchase interactive elements and in-app products in order to experience it in the full capacity. Moreover, the app displays ads which can spoil the fun and make playing the game less entertaining.
