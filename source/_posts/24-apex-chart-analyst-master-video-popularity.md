## Why Do We Need to Check YouTube Ranking?

#### Allows You to Know if Your Videos Are Performing Well

The main goal of most users is to rank number one on search results. So checking your rank position will help you know if your videos appear on YouTube and Google's top results. Most users watch videos on the top of search results. For this reason, if you are not ranking at the top of search results, you will miss out on traffic.

Knowing where you rank on search results will allow you to develop an effective strategy that will help you increase your views and grow your following.

Question: What will affect the ranking of your YouTube video?
