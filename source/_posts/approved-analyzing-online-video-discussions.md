Are you trying to search for something on a document or a web page? You know how to do that. You use the combination ‘Ctrl + F’ for Windows or ‘Command + F’ for Mac. But searching comments from the YouTube comments section can be tricky because –

1. There are many comments on the video, most of which do not load immediately. You can keep scrolling and still not find the desired comment.
2. Managing and analyzing the vast number of comments can be difficult for as busy a platform as YouTube.

So, if you want to search YouTube comments quickly, what can you do? We will show you in this blog.

## Part 1: Using the Built-in YouTube Studio Feature to Search Comments

How does the built-in YouTube Studio Feature make searching comments on YouTube easier?

Comments are the best way to interact with subscribers on YouTube. YouTube’s Studio is a new addition to help creators filter and respond to comments and create a [healthy community](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Sometimes, YouTubers also receive hateful and inappropriate comments. You can use the Studio Feature to report or delete those comments as well.

If you have a channel, you can use this feature in some simple steps.

1. Visit YouTube[website](https://www.youtube.com/) on your desktop and sign in to your YouTube account.
2. Go to the top right corner of your homepage, and you will find your profile icon. Click on it and from the drop-down menu, select the YouTube Studio option.
3. This will take you to the YouTube Studio home page. On the left side, find and click on the Comments option, and then you will see all comments your YouTube channel has received.
4. You can now click on the Filter icon from the comments section and type in the search term directly. Or, you can click the Search from the options, and type in the words you are looking for.
5. Click on Apply, and you will see the comments with the keywords you chose.

Besides the comment search feature, the YouTube Studio also has some in-built search filter categories, such as –

**Search:** Search for comments with particular search terms. You can also search comments posted by a specific channel by using their username as the search term.

**Contains questions:** Filter the comments which have questions.

**Channel member status:** Search for comments from the channel members. YouTube channel membership is only available to channels joined YouTube Partner Program.

**Subscriber count:** Filter comments with the channel subscriber count, you can search for comments from channels with a minimum number of subscribers (from 100-10M).

**Response status:** Filter the comments to which you have responded or haven’t responded to.

This feature is helpful as it lists more than the number of comments made by someone.
