 Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions

To make it easier for its audience to find crisp and entertaining content, YouTube has recently come up with a dedicated “Shorts” feature.

Ideally, any YouTube user can find the Shorts option on the app to watch interesting videos of 60 seconds or less. Though, it might take a lot of effort to make your YouTube Shorts videos appealing.

If you also want to go viral, then get to know about these **YouTube Shorts tips** that every content creator should follow.

## YouTube Shorts Feature and Shorts Fund: Things to Know

Before we make you familiar with all kinds of **YouTube Shorts tips and tricks**, let’s cover some basics. Ideally, YouTube has recently come up with the Shorts feature to focus on short-length videos (and to rival Instagram Reels and TikTok).

You can now find the Shorts icon at the bottom panel on the YouTube app. Using it, you can watch or record short videos on YouTube easily. These are short-form clips of 60 seconds or less that you can create via the Shorts interface of the YouTube app.

The interface would let you record multiple videos at different intervals and add sound to your clips as well. Later, you can post these short clips on your channel to get more views on YouTube.

### YouTube Shorts Fund

YouTube Shorts already hosts a massive number of more than 6 billion daily views as of now. To promote it, Google has come up with a YouTube Shorts Fund of **$100M** that would be rewarded to various content creators each month.

That is, a “Shorts Bonus” would be added to the account of content creators to appreciate their viral content.

## Top 10 Tips for YouTube Shorts That You Must Follow

Now when we have covered all the basics, let’s get to know about some effective **YouTube Shorts tricks** that would help you come up with interesting content and get more audience for it.

### Tip 1: Learn How to Shoot YouTube Shorts

Before you start posting videos on YouTube Shorts, you should know how the feature works. Ideally, you can find a dedicated option for Shorts from the bottom panel on the updated YouTube app. From here, you can watch Shorts or simply choose to create them as well.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-2.jpg)

You can give YouTube access to your smartphone camera before you start recording. To record anything, you can just tap and hold the red button (the recording icon) on the interface.

As you would release it, the recording would be stopped. In this way, you can seamlessly move from one scene to another without worrying about editing in post-production.

### Tip 2: Stick to a Selective Niche

To have a consistent growth of audience on YouTube shorts, you should stick to a specific niche. If you search on YouTube, you can find short videos related to funny, inspirational, fitness, romantic, and all kinds of niches.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-3.jpg)

Most of the prominent content creators already apply these **YouTube Shorts tips** in which they first identify their target audience. Based on that, you can work on the type of content that you want to create and share to attain consistent growth on YouTube.

### Tip 3: Add Appropriate Background Music to Your Short Videos

One of the best things about YouTube Shorts is that it lets us add a snippet of the music in the background, according to our content. Therefore, you must implement these **tips for** **YouTube Shorts** to make the most of this free feature of the app.

After recording your videos, you can tap on the “Sound” or the “Add Music” feature from the interface.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-4.jpg)

Now, YouTube will automatically load all kinds of trending music that you can use for free. If you want, you can enter the name of any song on the search option of YouTube shorts.

As you would select a track, it will automatically be loaded as the background music for your video. Though, you can also select a specific segment of the track and clip it accordingly to place it on your videos the way you like.

### Tip 4: Insert Captions and Text Effects on Your Shorts

Apart from music, you can also add all kinds of text effects to make your YouTube Shorts videos appealing. After you have recorded a video, you can just tap on the text option from the bottom/side panel of the app.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-5.jpg)

You can now type anything and place it on the video to make it more interesting. If you want, you can also implement these **YouTube Shorts tips** to add subtitles or pre/post video captions without any hassle.

### Tip 5: Adjust the Playback Speed of YouTube Shorts

Since a lot of content creators are coming up with YouTube Shorts, you would have to walk an extra mile to make them more appealing. In these **YouTube Shorts tricks**, I would recommend adjusting the playback speed of the video.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-6.jpg)

After recording the video, you can tap on the speed icon from the bottom/side panel. Here, you can make your videos play in slow motion or fast forward (in a range of 0.3x to 3x). This will add seamless speed control features to your videos without any technical issues.

### Tip 6: Consider the Overall Length of Your Shorts Video

Even though the maximum length of the YouTube Shorts videos is 60 seconds, you don’t have to make it so long. If you look at most of the popular videos on YouTube Shorts, then you will find that they are of less than 30 seconds in length.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-7.jpg)

Remember, your goal is to come up with crisp and interesting content via YouTube Shorts. To implement these **YouTube Shorts tips**, you can consider the ideal length of 30-45 seconds and only have essential content in your videos.

### Tip 7: Use the Timer Feature to Shoot Your Videos Correctly

A lot of people make the rookie mistake of shooting their videos for too long in Shorts. Therefore, if you want to implement these **YouTube Shorts tips and tricks**, then consider using the timer feature of the app.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-8.jpg)

Before shooting the video, you can tap on the timer button from the bottom and set up a preferred duration for it (like 10 or 15 seconds). In this way, you can be sure that you won’t go overboard and keep your videos short automatically.

### Tip 8: Set a Preferred Target Audience for YouTube Shorts

Great! Now when you have recorded and edited your video by applying these **tips for YouTube Shorts**, you are ready to post them. While posting your videos, you would be asked whether the video is targeted at kids or not. If the video is made for kids, then you should select the relevant prompt, as YouTube would improve the overall visibility of your videos in this case.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-9.jpg)

Though, if your videos are targeted at adults, then you should go with the second option instead. This would help you reach out to your target audience on YouTube easily.

### Tip 9: Post Your YouTube Shorts the Right Way

Apart from setting the audience preferences of your YouTube Shorts videos, you should also take care of a couple of other things. For instance, you can consider making the visibility of your final video “Public” so that anyone on YouTube can watch it.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-10.jpg)

Besides that, it is also recommended to have the keyword “#Shorts” in the title of the video. You can also make the title of the video attractive and can even add a short description that would make your audience click on your YouTube video for sure.

### Tip 10: Promote Your YouTube Shorts Video on Other Places

Lastly, posting the YouTube Shorts video is not enough, as you should also promote it to get more views. One of the best **YouTube Shorts tips** for promotion would be posting the snippet of the video as your Stories on YouTube.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-tips-11.jpg)

You can also post your YouTube Shorts on other popular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. by sharing their link. In this way, you can easily redirect your audience from other platforms and increase the visibility of your video.

### Bonus Tip: Use a Professional Editor for Your YouTube Shorts Videos

As you can see after going through these **YouTube Shorts tricks** that the native tool of the app has limited editing options. Therefore, if you want to come up with better videos, then consider using a professional tool like [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
