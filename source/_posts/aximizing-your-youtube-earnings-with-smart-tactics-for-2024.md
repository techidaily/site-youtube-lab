### 1\. Google AdSense

YouTube channel monetization is the most popular method. By adding AdSense to your videos, you can generate revenue from the ads displayed. You must adhere to our advertiser-friendly guidelines when creating your videos. The monetization of all videos may not be possible, therefore. YouTube and AdSense work seamlessly together.

### 6\. Invest in crowd-funding

It's not just for startups anymore; you can use crowdfunding to fund content creation on YouTube as well. You can find people to support your work through third-party applications like Patreon in exchange for perks. You can now place sponsor buttons on your YouTube videos, which allows you to crowdfund. With this, you can offer rewards in exchange for monthly funding like with Patreon.
