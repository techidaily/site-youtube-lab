Step2 Navigate to the top of the screen and select Effects. Choose AI Portrait from the left-hand side. After that, drag-n-drop a preferred AI Portrait effect to the Timeline. Then, adjust it to the section of your video you want it to be displayed.

Step5 Change the position where the Subscribe watermark should appear in your video. Then, play the video to preview it.

Step6 After you’re done with the editing, click the Export button from the top bar and choose Burn DVD from the drop-down list that shows up.
