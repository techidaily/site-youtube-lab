One of the greatest problems facing many YouTube creators is capturing views. It's hard to crack the top search engine rankings as a small channel. Many people on YouTube would probably love their content, but all of those views are going to already popular channels.

Many YouTubers look for alternative ways to get views for their videos, not to replace organic views, but to better position their videos to be seen by real viewers. Buying views or signing up for a view exchange platform are two methods some YouTubers consider, and another is bots.

**View exchange platforms are allowed, and buying views is grey, but bots are against the rules. Warning:** be aware that increasing your view count with a bot is against YouTube's Terms of Service and that if you get caught, your video will be taken down. If you still wish to learn more about bots, keep reading. If you want safer options, scroll down to 'Alternatives to Bots.'

## What Is A YouTube View Bot?

Bots work in an automated sense, just like software, and they can run in the background. Bots automatically add views to your videos.

Setting up a bot can be as easy as using other pieces of software, and there are lots of free tutorials on YouTube for view bots.

## Why Use a YouTube View Bot?

Bots are used to create the illusion that a video is already popular to attract real viewers who view the existing view count as 'social proof' of the video's quality. The main benefit is that it is fast, easy, and usually free. There are other ways, besides bots, bot accomplishes this, but if a YouTuber is resorting to a bot, it probably means they don't have the money to buy real human views or the time to participate in a view exchange platform.

Bots can also be used to generate comments and likes for videos.

## What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?

The most effective bots come with more features than bypassing Captchas and generating views.

You can set up a YouTube bot to perform daily tasks and automate your workflow. An example might be ensuring that every video on your page gets a view and comment every day. You can also use bots (or content organization platforms) to share your videos across social media automatically. This frees you up to focus on creating quality content.

Using a bot to increase your views artificially has its dangers, but it also has the potential to kick start the organic growth of your channel. Once you start attracting real viewers and subscribers, you will not need to keep relying on a bot.

## Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?

 **Yes.**

Bots are against YouTube's TOS, especially for partners using AdSense ([learn more about YouTube's partnership program here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)). Suppose you are suspected of using a bot. In that case, your videos can get taken down, and you could lose the ability to monetize content (YouTube reviews channels now before they can monetize, and it will be obvious to them if you've used a bot to get to the 10,000 lifetime views you need for monetization). Repeated offenses could even get you banned from YouTube, and it is much easier to lose AdSense access.

The biggest danger isn't YouTube taking your videos down, though. So long as you don't persist after being warned, you can always recover. No, the real danger of bots is that they generate low retention views. Essentially, the views you get from a bot appear to YouTube's algorithm as if people have clicked on your videos but haven't watched them. The algorithm interprets that as 'the people clicking on this don't like it, we should rank it lower down in search results. Rather than attracting organic views, bots can make it very difficult for a real viewer to find your content.

If you are going to use a bot, you need to use it smartly and sparingly to prevent damage to your channel.
