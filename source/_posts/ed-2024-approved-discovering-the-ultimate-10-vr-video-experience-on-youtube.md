## Part 3: Where to Watch VR Videos besides YouTube?

You may wonder whether there are other platforms where you can watch VR videos.

The good news is: Yes! Besides YouTube, we have platforms where viewers can watch VR videos and have an immersive experience. Read on to know them.

**1\. Vimeo 360**

This platform allows users to upload, play, and even share their VR videos with their friends on apps like Facebook and YouTube.

**2\. Oculus Gear VR store**

Users can watch their YouTube VR Oculus videos on this platform with apps like Samsung XR, Skybox VR video player, etc. They are also allowed to download games apps.

**3\. Steam Powered**

Steam Powered is known for VR titles and gets support from good VR headsets.

## Part 4: Choose High-Quality VR Headsets

There are quite a good number of VR Headsets, but we have the option of choosing a high-quality VR headset that should be able to deliver a wonderful experience. This is what every user wants. Let's take a good look at a few of them.

### 1. **Oculus Quest 2**

This VR headset is top-notch. Its impressive flexibility, backed by its shocking price, will make one not want to look elsewhere.

No need to worry about screen-door effects as the headset possesses a high per-eye resolution—smooth 90Hz refreshing rate just like the Rift CV1 Oculus. Based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset, XR2 resulted in excellent standalone performance. It's also capable of linking up with gaming PC for desktop experiences.

### 2. **PlayStation VR**

A lot of VR games have come out on PlayStation VR. The PlayStation VR gives PS4 users an excellent and quality experience. However, it doesn't have the highest resolution displays and cannot go for wild, room-scale tracking.

It has a 960 x 1,080 per-eye resolution and offers a 120Hz refresh rate for quality experiences. Its 100-degree field of view, motion controllers, and separate camera are suitable for unlocking immersive gameplay. A fantastic thing about it is that although it was for the PS4 and PS4 Pro, Sony ensured it'll also run on the PS5.
