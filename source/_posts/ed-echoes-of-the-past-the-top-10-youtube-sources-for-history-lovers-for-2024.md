Even the different tribes, arts, and cultures. They post videos twice a week

### 7. Oversimplified

Normally, no one likes the idea of listening or learning from someone who makes things too complicated. Also, when learning, it is more interesting if you could understand it in the best way that you can. Not everything can be learned that way and not everyone can make something that easy to grasp. Channels like oversimplified make things easier for everyone to understand. They oversimplify their contents. They give you histories like the French revolution and the battle of Hastings and make it funnier and twist the storytelling to a way that people would find it interesting and funny sometimes. Videos are posted three times a week

Things like the wild wide west and the New York blackout that happened in 1977\. Other things like how Europeans discovered Alaska and the great olive poisoning that happened in 1919\. He makes the videos short because he aims at getting the audience in their spare time. Videos are posted 3 to 4 times a week
