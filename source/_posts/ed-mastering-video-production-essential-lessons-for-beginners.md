## 3\. Jump Cut: YouTube Influencer 101 Crash Course

This course consists of 4 emails each one with a link to a video where Jesse, the instructor, walks you through 4 ideologies of creating compelling content that expands your reach and grows our channel.

So this course is serious business.

## 4\. Alison: Introduction to Digital Photography
