The clarity on the relevance of YouTube in this dispensation when it comes to branding or business-boosting is immense. Many savvy entrepreneurs and business companies have come to the known for their beautiful advantages.

How then can one create his own business YouTube account?

**1\. Signing into a Google account**

To successfully start using the YouTube app, there is a need to sign officially into Google. If you've it in mind to have a separate Google account for your business account, you kick-start it at this stage.

However, you can still use your name to open a Google account and create a business YouTube account for subsequent use. The truth is that YouTube gives room for you still to make a **business account** with a business name thus, eliminating the need to use a business name in creating your Google account.

**2\. Creating a business name**

Once you create a Google account, the next step is to make your business a YouTube account. This you do by either signing into your YouTube app or via the YouTube website in your mobile browser. Once logged in to the app interface, you will see the profile photo you used in creating your Google account or the initial letter of the first name you used on the top right-hand side of your mobile. Tap on it, and a drop-down menu will come up, tap on the 'create a channel' icon, which will lead you to another interface where you have the option to select 'Get started' or 'No thanks.' A tap on the get started will reveal an option to either create your channel using the name and image of your Google account or use a customized name.

**3\. Customize your business page**

At this point, you can design the layout by utilizing the appealing icon and banner of your choice, just as provided by the likes of Facebook or Twitter. The customized templates in Canva are there for you to design your page to your state.
