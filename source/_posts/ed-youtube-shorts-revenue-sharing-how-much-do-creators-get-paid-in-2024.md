## YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing: How Much Do Creators Get Paid?

YouTube Shorts have become a craze in the recent past as creators try to get the best out of them. These are short, vertical videos that are 60 seconds long. Originally a way of YouTube attempting to compete with TikTok, Shorts have become a household name. However, are YouTube shorts monetized? Can you get paid for YouTube shorts? The increasing interest in monetizing Shorts has inspired many creators working on their video creation. This article answers the question of **can YouTube Shorts be monetized** and explains how the revenue-sharing model works.

## **Part 1\. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing**

YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?

![youtube shorts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG)

Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.

The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down

* Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.
* YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.
* YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.
* From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.

So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.

## **Part 2\. YouTube Shorts Monetization: Eligibility Criteria and Earnings Potential**

YouTube Shorts provides creators with an exceptional way of making extra income. Let’s have a look at what it takes and what the numbers say:

### **Eligibility** **Criteria**

If you are wondering, can I monetize YouTube shorts? To start earning ad revenue from Shorts, you need to be part of the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) This is the gateway to YouTube monetization opportunities. With the latest YouTube shorts monetization 2023 policy, the platform lowered the eligibility criteria.

![youtube shorts monetization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-2.JPG)

To be eligible to the YPP, you will need:

* At least 500 Subscribers
* At least 3,000 valid public hours in the last 12 months, or
* At least 3M valid public Shorts views in the last 90 days

This means that your YouTube channel must have gained some traction before monetizing your shorts. The following YouTube short monetization 2023 requirements are also needed:
