### Step 1: Choose your template and layout

Canva is an online tool to make YouTube banner, so first you need to [open it up](https://www.canva.com/create/banners/youtube-banners/). You are asked to log in.

After you’ve signed up for Canva you will see a variety of different templates. Scroll through them until you find **YouTube Channel Art** under **Social Media & Email Headers**.

This template will be the right size for a YouTube banner, but it will not show you the ‘safe zones’. Your banner will show up differently depending on the screen a viewer is watching on. [Click here to download YouTube’s official template, which displays safe zones.](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/723CF6954B9CC9B50AD58BCC2F5F14825FF4) You will be able to use it as a reference.

And Canva also provides you with sample layouts that you can build off of. They will include stock photos and text. Most are free, but some might cost a dollar.

![choose template and layout](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-template1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
If the one you happen to like isn’t free, don’t worry. It’s actually just the specific stock images being used in the example that cost money, and you’re probably planning on replacing those anyways.

### Step 2: Import your image

Canva provides a selection of stock images you can use for free. You can find them by clicking on **Elements** in the menu on the far left, and then clicking on **Free Photos**.

If you’d rather use your own images, click on **Upload** at the bottom of that same menu on the left. You’ll have the option of uploading images from your computer or importing them from Facebook.

After you have found the image you want to use or loaded it into Canva, click on it and it will appear in your layout.
