## Benefits for Using YouTube in Classroom

**Global connection**

 YouTube makes it possible for teachers to share their lessons with millions of potential students located in different parts of the world, something which was unthinkable with the traditional modes of teaching a few years ago. Teachers can now collaborate, connect and innovate with a multitude of students in ways that were never imagined before by employing the power of YouTube.

**Enhances the comprehension of complex topics**

 Certain subjects are technical in nature and teachers usually have a hard time explaining them to the students. By using YouTube in the classroom, teachers are an a better position to offer clear and easy to understand illustrations which will in turn demystify the tough concepts and make it easy for students to understand and comprehend complex topics.

**Creates more engagement from students**

 Learning primarily comprises of audio and visual components. Unlike traditional modes of teaching where the teacher offered explanation and the students are expected to take notes, videos are more engaging and has the power to make students stay more alert, thus increase their chances of absorbing the lesions and getting most from the subjects.

**Ideal for slow learners**

 When using YouTube in the classroom, the teacher has full control on the pace of learning and this is ideal for taking of both the fast and slow learners. In case a student finds a concept being explained too fast, they can simply request the part to be replayed or it can be slowed down to play at a pace that will be easy for them to grasp.

**One teacher, multiple classrooms**

 The other benefit of using YouTube in the classroom is that after a teacher prepares his learning videos, they get the flexibility using the video in more than just one classroom. It also makes it easy for them when they are away and they need to attend classes. All they have to do is to use the prerecorded video lesions so that they don’t entirely miss out on classes.
