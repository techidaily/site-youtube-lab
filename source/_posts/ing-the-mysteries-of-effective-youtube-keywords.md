Using the YouTube suggest API, Keyword Keg shows you the terms users search most and the monthly number of searches. You'll also see what other people are paying for CPC (cost per click). You can use this data to determine the best keywords for your YouTube videos.

Qusetion: Are keywords and Tags the Same Thing?

Answer: The main difference between tags and keywords is where you will place them. Keywords describe the content in your video to help search engines and YouTube's algorithm find your video. Tags describe what the content in your video is about and how it's connected.
