The main goal of most users is to rank number one on search results. So checking your rank position will help you know if your videos appear on YouTube and Google's top results. Most users watch videos on the top of search results. For this reason, if you are not ranking at the top of search results, you will miss out on traffic.

Knowing where you rank on search results will allow you to develop an effective strategy that will help you increase your views and grow your following.

#### Help You See Your Progress

Knowing that you are appearing on the top search results is a clear sign that you have optimized your video titles, description, and content for the right keywords. In turn, more people will view your videos, and your channel will gain more subscribers.

#### Allows You to Change Your Low Ranking State

If you are ranking low, you will know that you need to enhance user experience and optimize your content for relevance. You will change your content and ensure it is engaging and suitable for your target audience.

Question: What will affect the ranking of your YouTube video?

Some of the things that can affect the ranking of your YouTube videos include the quality of your content. If your video is large and not optimized for mobile devices, this can also affect your rank on search results.
