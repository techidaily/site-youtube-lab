 Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions

Well, a YouTube Shorts is said to be YouTube's short-form answer to TikTok. You can quickly scroll via algorithmically-driven feed, discover other similar short videos, and subscribe to your favorite creators.

Here, creators can record, share, and edit short-form video content that's 60 seconds or less and vertically oriented. And, unlike Instagram stories, YouTube Shorts won't disappear but will remain on your channel. So, that’s the brief intro of YouTube Shorts which we think everyone is aware of after YouTube has announced its YouTube Shorts availability globally.

However, certain factors are still there, raising the issue or concern of **YouTube Shorts not showing**. Thus, if you can't find the YouTube Shorts option or videos, or YouTube Shorts disappeared, find a solution in this post.

## Part 1: Why Do YouTube Shorts Not Showing Up?

There could be multiple reasons why YouTube Shorts not showing on your phone, the channel's home page etc.

Besides, many scenarios arise with this issue, namely the YouTube Shorts option not showing up, the YouTube Shorts button missing, and YouTube Shorts videos not showing correctly.

And, there are valid reasons as well as to why these situations are happening to you. So, let's discuss each of them separately in brief, along with the solutions in the next section.

* **YouTube Shorts are not showing on the channel's homepage**

The standard and the most common reason why YouTube Shorts are not showing on the channel's homepage is that you have not updated the YouTube app.

* **YouTube Shorts option not showing up**

This may be happening either because you've not updated the app or your internet connection is pretty slow to show you the option. There could be another reason as you may not have cleared the YouTube mobile app's cache and data.

* **YouTube Shorts button missing**

Again, you may not have updated the YouTube app, or your internet connection is slow is the most common reason here. Moreover, the button of YouTube Shorts stays hidden behind the +icon.

* **YouTube Shorts videos not showing correctly**

The most valid reason for YouTube Shorts not showing correctly or YouTube Shorts disappearing is that you have a poor internet connection. Plus, we've discussed proper steps below if you've missed something while uploading the YouTube Shorts triggering this scenario.

Before we move on to fixing YouTube Shorts not showing the issue, here’s a quick note on which videos qualify as YouTube Shorts. Shorts are different from YouTube stories. Unlike YouTube stories, it gets displayed in your regular channel feed along with your other YouTube videos.

And, you must note that a YouTube Shorts video consists of two criteria as follows.

* The video has to be vertical (portrait-style)
* The video must be 60 seconds or less

## Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Shorts Not Showing Up?

Here’s the section covering fixes on YouTube Shorts not showing. Please give it a read and resolve your issue happily!

### Fix 1: Update the YouTube App

As we've already discussed above, check if your YouTube mobile app has the latest version. The newest version of the YouTube mobile app (Version: 16.17.36) has a dedicated Shorts button at the bottom. And, it replaces the Trending button from the YouTube app.

Moreover, the option to upload Shorts is now hidden behind the **+** icon. Tap on the **+** icon and hit the **Create a Short** option.

### Fix 2: Check If Shorts Is Available in Your Country

Now, YouTube Shorts is available globally, but there was a phase when YouTube Shorts was a beta feature. It was only available in India and the US, which could be why you could not view Shorts in the YouTube app.

### Fix 3: YouTube Shorts Is Mobile-only

As of now, YouTube Shorts is only available on a smartphone because it's still in beta version. However, you can create Shorts via smartphone and the camera option in YouTube mobile app. Hence, there's no point in searching for Shorts on your computer.

You can upload Shorts videos from your laptop. The entire process is similar to uploading a regular video. However, you have to mention #Shorts in the title and description to differentiate it as a Shorts video.

### Common Fixes to YouTube Shorts Not Working

1. Update the YouTube App to the latest version.
2. Clear the YouTube mobile app's data and cache.
3. Check if your internet is connected or your internet connection is strong.
4. Restart your smartphone and try again.
5. The YouTube server can be down, busy, or under maintenance. Wait for a while and try again.

The fixes above are also applicable if the YouTube Shorts are not showing on iPhone as well.

Or, you can try the VPN solution before contacting the YouTube team.

### If Videos Are Not Visible under YouTube Shorts

**Solution 1:** Ensure that you've added #shorts in the title and description. Those who have YouTube Shorts, they can make shorts videos via the Shorts camera. Those who can't access this camera can also upload their current vertical videos that are less than 60 seconds after adding the hashtag #Shorts in the title or description.

All in all, you must include #shorts to let the YouTube algorithm figure out the video is created for Shorts, and the issue of YouTube Shorts not showing up will also be resolved.

**Solution 2:** Sometimes, you may not find YouTube Shorts videos if they're precisely 60 seconds in duration because YouTube sometimes adds 1-2 seconds to a Shorts video for some reason. So, be alert here and ensure your Shorts video is around 58 seconds or less.

**Solution 3:** If your YouTube Shorts is not getting views, you need to wait more here because it takes a while for YouTube to index a Shorts video and suggest them to people. So, it's the task of the algorithm that varies from person to person. Some Shorts videos take several days while others take weeks.

### If YouTube Shorts Videos Are Not Showing up Correctly

Once uploaded, the YouTube Shorts will be displayed in a vertical thumbnail on YouTube and other regular content already there in your account. Or, it's your choice to create a new channel for the YouTube shorts videos. If the YouTube shorts not showing correctly, you can try as follows:

**Step 1.** Go to your channel and select the "customize channel" option.

**Step 2\.** Hop on to the **Featured** section, and choose the **add section**.

**Step 3.** You'll see shorts videos under the "videos" section. Click that, and the videos you have which are tagged in with #shorts in the title or description will automatically display here.

### Bonus Tip: How to Easily Create Vertical Videos for YouTube Shorts on PC

The YouTube Shorts app is pretty convenient to use nowadays. However, it doesn't allow you to fine-edit the videos if you've explored the app or specifically when you want your videos to look more professional. The app doesn't even have many filtering options, such as Effects, Elements, etc., to make your videos more interactive.

With that said, you can always use an efficient third-party program like [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create professional-looking YouTube Shorts videos to engage your viewers highly. Even no famous YouTuber uploads their videos directly from the app without using any third-party tool.

We recommend Wondershare Filmora because it is a production and post-production app available for Windows and Mac computers. It gives tough competition to some globally renowned tools like Final Cut Pro X, Adobe Premiere Pro, etc., because of its simplicity. Furthermore, Filmora has its inbuilt screen, voice recording features, and webcam that can be useful to create game walkthroughs, interactive videos, and voiceovers as needed.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Moreover, a YouTube Shorts video can be made through Wondershare Filmora using the below-mentioned guide.

**Note:** We are assuming that you have already recorded a vertical video using your smartphone and that it has been transferred to your PC.

So, the signature feature to create YouTube Shorts videos on Wondershare Filmora is **Auto Reframe**.

Powered by AI technology, Auto Reframe automatically identifies the focal point of your video and crops it while always maintaining it within the frame. This way, the main object or action in your video never goes out of vision.

You can choose an aspect ratio that best fits YouTube Shorts which is **9:16**.

#### How to Use Auto Reframe in Filmora?

**Step 1\. Open Filmora and Select Auto Reframe**

You can choose among three ways to open the Auto Reframe feature in Filmora.

      * **Way 1:** Once you open Filmora, the main interface will display the **Auto Reframe** tab on the right-hand panel. Click it to open directly

**Step 2\. Adjust the Aspect Ratio and Motion Speed**

A separate dialog box will display once you have selected the **Auto Reframe** option. Now, click on **Import Media** and choose a single video to import. You can change the imported video by hitting the **Replace File** at the top menu.

There are multiple aspect ratio templates available such as square (1:1), vertical (9:16), standard (4:3), widescreen (16:9), and cinema (21:9). As you are making YouTube Shorts, so you need to select **9:16**.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/4-select-reframing-aspect-ratio.jpg)

You can adjust the speed of your video in multiple options: keep it at **Auto** or make it **Slow** or **Fast** as per your requirements.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/5-select-motion-speed.jpg)

**Step 3\. Analyze, and Auto Reframe the Video**

Once you finish the above adjustments, hit the **Analysis** tab. Filmora will take a few seconds to finish analyzing your video project.

Then the video will be automatically and quickly reframed to your specified speed and aspect ratio. You can modify these aspect ratios and speed options by hitting the **Restart** option as well.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/7-restart-reframing.jpg)

**Step 4\. Preview the Reframed Video and Check**

Lastly, you can preview your final video. If the video needs more work, you can also play and pause it at the point you want to adjust the frame. You can use **Next Edit Point**, **Undo**, **Redo**, and **Previous Edit Point** at the bottom panel.

**Step 5\. Export the Reframed Video**

Finally, after all the final adjustments, you can hit the **Export** tab, name your file and choose the destination folder.
