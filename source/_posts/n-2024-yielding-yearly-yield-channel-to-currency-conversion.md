YouTube is more than a video sharing social network; here's how to get paid on YouTube. Having an active YouTube channel with decent monthly views can earn you income through advertising. If your channel is set up properly, Google can place ads over your YouTube videos and you can earn money based on how many people see or click on (depends on the ad) those ads while watching your videos.

## Part 1: The Requirements for YouTube Monetization

Meeting the minimum requirement for YouTube monetization is probably the hardest part of this whole process. About a month ago, you had to have 10,000 lifetime views on your YouTube channel to qualify for monetization. However, earlier this year, Google changed their eligibility requirements and made them even tougher.

As of February 20, 2018, YouTube channels need to have accumulated 4000 hours of ‘watch time’ over the past 12 months and no less than 1000 subscribers to qualify for monetization. If you do not meet these requirements you cannot join the YouTube Partner Program and monetize your YouTube channel.

So, the first step to successful monetization on YouTube is to actually grow your channel. You need to create videos that will attract viewers and engage your audience. You also need to get people to subscribe because this is really what will grow your YouTube channel over time.

## Part 2: How To Enable Monetization for Your YouTube Channel

Here’s the step-by-step process for monetizing your YouTube Channel, for those who are qualified.

1. Log in to your YouTube account.
1. Find your account icon in the top right corner. Click it to find the ‘Creator Studio’ button.
1. Click the ‘Creator Studio’ button.
1. Click the ‘Channel’ option in the left side menu.
1. You’ll see a drop-down menu under ‘Channel’. Click on ‘Status and Features’. This is actually the first option on the menu. It should open by default once you click the ‘Channel’ button.
1. Look through the ‘Status and Features’ page and click the ‘Enable’ button beside monetization.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

1. Clicking the ‘Enable’ button should lead you to another page where the guidelines for monetization are explained. Take the time to read through the guidelines and understand the dos and don’ts of YouTube monetization.
1. Once you’ve looked through the guidelines, click the ‘Enable my account’ button to proceed. This will lead you to a page where you’ll be prompted to join the YouTube Partner Program.
1. Read through the YouTube Partner Program terms, check the appropriate boxes, and click the ‘accept’ button.
1. You’ll be prompted to link an AdSense account.
1. Connect an existing AdSense account if you have one or create a new one.
1. Once you’re done linking an AdSense account, you’ll be redirected to YouTube. There, select the type of ads you want to run under ‘Monetization Preferences’.
1. Click the submit button and wait to find out if your account is approved for monetization.

According to YouTube, it can take up to a week for a decision to be reached on your application.

YouTube will not review your monetization application until you’ve met their eligibility criteria. Even then, your application may be declined if your videos do not follow the community guidelines (i.e. channels which simply repost content from other channels will not be monetized).

Not all videos can be monetized. While there are legal ways to create videos consisting of imagery and footage belonging to others, be aware that such videos are not always eligible for monetization. YouTube will only monetize videos that you own. So, posting videos which do not belong to you or which include copyrighted content can cause your monetization application to be declined.

## Part 3: Linking Your Bank Account To Your AdSense Account

AdSense offers a variety of payment options including mailed checks and Western Union transfers. However, these options may not be available to you depending on where you’re based. AdSense does make payments through electronic wire transfer (EFT – Electronic funds transfer) to virtually every country in the world, and this is the preferred payment option for most people.

To have your earnings deposited directly into your account through EFT, you’ll need to link your bank account to your AdSense account.

Here’s a step-by-step guide for linking your bank account to your AdSense account.

1. Log in to AdSense via: [www.google.com/adsense/start](http://www.google.com/adsense/start)
1. Click the ‘Settings’ button in the left panel menu
1. Under ‘Settings’, click ‘Payments’.
1. On the ‘Payments’ page, click ‘Manage payment options’.
1. Click ‘Add payment method’.
1. Next, you’ll be prompted to add your bank account details. In general, you will be asked to provide the following:  
   1. _Name on the account / account holder’s name_  
   2. _Bank account number_  
   3. _Bank name_  
   4. _Bank SWIFT code_  
   5. _Depending on where you are based, additional information may be required._
1. Ensure that the name on your AdSense account matches the name on the bank account you provide. To edit your AdSense name, click the ‘Manage settings’ button also on the Payments page.

## Part 4: Receiving Payments

To get paid by AdSense, you need to reach the $100 threshold. You may wish to set a higher threshold but as a rule, earnings below the $100 will not be processed for payment (you will still receive the money, it will just keep adding up until it gets to $100 and then you’ll be paid).

Also, bear in mind that AdSense follows a monthly payment cycle. This means that a month’s earnings (assuming they meet the threshold requirement) will be paid next month. Usually, direct deposit payments will be processed between the 21st and 26th of every month. That said, it can take up to 10 days for electronic wire payments to be received.

In addition to reaching the payment threshold, be sure that you have no payment hold on your AdSense account. A payment hold can cause your earnings to be withheld even if it has reached the payment threshold.

To avoid a payment hold, be sure to provide the necessary tax information, verify your identity and your address, make sure the bank account linked to your AdSense is verified, and make sure you have not violated any of YouTube’s guidelines and community rules.

**Conclusion**

Depending on your vlogging skills and the nature of your content (some types of videos get more attention than others), it can take a while for you to be eligible for monetization. And even when you’ve successfully monetized your channel, getting enough views to reach the payment threshold can be tough.

Don’t let this discourage you from working towards earning income from your YouTube channel. Just focus on creating a YouTube channel people will want to watch. That's how to get paid on YouTube - be sticking with your channel long enough for it to grow.
