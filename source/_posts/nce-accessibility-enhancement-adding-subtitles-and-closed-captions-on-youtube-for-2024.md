## Why subtitle and closed captions are important for YouTube videos?

* Forced closed captions and subtitles actually help the viewers to understand the content in your video if the audio quality of your video is bad, muffled or barely audible. Reading makes it easier for them to understand.
* This also helps people with hearing impairments. People with troubled ears can still watch and understand your content.
* It's a great aid to such videos which have been recorded in other foreign languages that you don't understand. Hence it will increase the number of viewers all around the world.
* They both are generally added for easy accessibility to the viewers who wish to watch in sound sensitive environments.

 So, here we are going to show you two ways to add subtittles to video: directly or uploading caption or transcript files
