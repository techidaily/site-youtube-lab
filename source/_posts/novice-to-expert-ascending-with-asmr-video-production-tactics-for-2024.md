## How to Make ASMR Videos: An Ultimate Guide

Are you confused about the first step to take on how to make ASMR videos? To make your work easier, we have come up with an ultimate guide that is all you need now.

#### 1\. Before Filming: How to Prepare

It is not that all the ASMR videos are the same, and all ASMR artists follow the same strategy. However, they follow different methodologies and triggers which you need to learn and understand. Before filming, you need to concentrate on the content based on which you are about to make the video. Research the videos made by the best ASMR makers and create content that is liked by the most.

Make sure your voice is melodic and soft, as that is what grabs the listener. Give importance to grooming, where skincare and make-up should be a pleasant one.

#### 2\. Shooting Videos

Start with the gadgets that you have on hand. For filming the ASMR video, all you need is an ordinary camera, two good headphones, and microphones to ensure good quality of sound deliverance to the audience. Keep out the noise resources like fans and any other electronic sources out of reach. Additionally, you do not need to look out for other professional tools or studio to film the video; instead, a noise-free room is enough.

## Tips on Making Your ASMR Videos Stand Out

Were you much moved by the concept of ASMR videos and artists? Are you eager as well to land a step on this latest trending sensation of ASMR? Here are some ways that can make your ASMR video stand out from the crowd.

#### 1\. Come up with a non-original content

If you are a newbie to the ASMR floor, rather than coming up with your original content, surf over the previous videos by ASMR artists. Find the popular topic, like the cranial nerve exam, hair-salon, policeman catching thieves, and doctor role-play. Gain experience from such unique ideas and give it a try before experimenting with your original content to attract a small audience.

#### 2\. Be natural

The most critical factor in creating an ASMR video is to be realistic all the time. If you observe the strategy used by ASMR artists, they use objects, tap it, and bring out new sounds that attract the audience. Similarly, you can use items as triggers to make the video enhancing or effective.

#### 3\. Be interactive

Want more subscribers towards your channel? The audiences always like the more interactive videos and the artists who have a good relationship with them. Alongside, people with insomnia and loneliness also surf for the ASMR videos that can offer a little relief where being interactive can drive personal attention.

#### 4\. Get a friend to accompany you

If it is your first ASMR video, and you are not sure how to proceed, you can get assistance from your friend who has prior experience in it. You can also incorporate them while making a video. Doing so will reduce your insecurity in-camera exposure.

#### 5\. Film videos at night

This option might sound crazy, but it’s true as you will not have a distraction like traffic, cars, dogs, people conversations, and loud noise that might affect the video quality.

#### 6\. Be proud

ASMR is becoming a growing trend, as said before, and it is a sensational topic. If you have decided to travel in that path, it is fair but think twice before you step into it. Do not feel embarrassed or discouraged if you get any negative comments. Tell yourself that you are making something useful to help someone.

### Conclusion

According to researches, such brain tingling phenomenon created by ASMR videos creates a positive physiological effect on its viewers. Hence it is also famously called ASMR sleep. While such tingling activities like tapping, whispers, and slow hand movements might seem crazy, they still profit from paving the way for physical and mental health. Do you shuffle a lot on an occupied working schedule? Then take some time to watch the best ASMR channels and relax. If you are passionate about becoming an ASMR artist like Gibi or Maria, follow the tips we have in store for you, and you are all set-to-go!
