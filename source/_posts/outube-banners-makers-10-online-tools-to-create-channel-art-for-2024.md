### Step 1: Choose your template and layout

Canva is an online tool to make YouTube banner, so first you need to [open it up](https://www.canva.com/create/banners/youtube-banners/). You are asked to log in.

After you’ve signed up for Canva you will see a variety of different templates. Scroll through them until you find **YouTube Channel Art** under **Social Media & Email Headers**.

This template will be the right size for a YouTube banner, but it will not show you the ‘safe zones’. Your banner will show up differently depending on the screen a viewer is watching on. [Click here to download YouTube’s official template, which displays safe zones.](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/723CF6954B9CC9B50AD58BCC2F5F14825FF4) You will be able to use it as a reference.

And Canva also provides you with sample layouts that you can build off of. They will include stock photos and text. Most are free, but some might cost a dollar.

![choose template and layout](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-template1.png)

If the one you happen to like isn’t free, don’t worry. It’s actually just the specific stock images being used in the example that cost money, and you’re probably planning on replacing those anyways.
