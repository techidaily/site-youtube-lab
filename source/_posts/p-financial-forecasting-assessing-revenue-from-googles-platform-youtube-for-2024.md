**CPM (Cost Per Mile):** CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.

**CPC (Cost Per Click):** Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.

**Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:** You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he/she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.
