YouTube is compatible to all devices such as smartphones, tablets and computers. However, when the screen is too small, so does the video, which makes the watching experience full of inconvenience.

Sometimes, you may need to rotate the video left/right 90 degrees or 180 degrees. To rotate the YouTube video when you watching it, you can move your devices in order for you to get the perfect angle and make your watching fun and smooth.

Yet, did you know that you could possibly rotate YouTube videos either downloaded or before uploading, to the angle you are comfortable watching? Here is how.

## Method 1: Using YouTube Video Editor to Rotate Videos \[Not available after 2017\]

**Note:** After updating in 2017 September, you cannot rotate a video on YouTube Enhancement. If you need to rotate a video, you should rotate the video before uploading it to YouTube.

YouTube has a built-in video editor where you can rotate YouTube video. Here are the ways on how you can successfully rotate a YouTube video online.

* Log in to your YouTube account.
* Click the dropdown located beside your profile's thumbnail that can be found in your dashboard.
* Once you have successfully clicked the dropdown menu, you can now search for the video that you want to rotate.
* When you have already found the video, you can now click the Edit button that can easily be found under the thumbnail of the video.
* In the Edit section, choose the Enhancements tab.
* You can find in the lower right part of the video preview the arrows for rotate right and rotate left.

* **\[Not Recommended\]** There is a hacky way to show Rotate button on 2021\. Right click on the **Trim** button and click **inspect** in the pop-up menu. A **DevTools** window will open with HTML codes of the **Trim** button highlighted as you can see it in the below image. Find **enhance-rotate-buttons** on the html codes, and delete the **hiddden=”true”**, then press the **Enter** button.

 **Cons of YouTube Video Editor**

However, using YouTube Video Editor is not the best way to rotate or flip a YouTube video.

* Obviously, one of its disadvantages is that the features are very basic. You can't use more advanced functions for better edition.
* In addition, since you are doing it online, you need to keep on refreshing the page whenever you are making some changes in your video, which eats a lot of time.
* Another disadvantage of YouTube Video Editor is that you have to get access to internet, or you can't edit the videos. But it's headache when you forget to save your work or the internet crashes.
