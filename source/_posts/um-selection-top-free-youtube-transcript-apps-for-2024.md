## Bonus Tips: Easily Edit Your Subtitle With Filmora

Since most of the above tools only extract or download the YouTube subtitles and do not offer editing features, we recommend using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), where you can quickly apply changes to your SRT file.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Filmora is a powerful video editing software that lets you create and edit clips like a pro. With its easy-to-use UI and wide range of features, you can also create and edit subtitles for your YouTube video using different parameters, animations, text styles, templates, and colors.

![filmora vide editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmora-vide-editor.png)

Here's how you can add and edit subtitles on your videos using Filmora:

Step 1 Open the **Filmora software** on your laptop or desktop and click the **"Create New Project"** option in the main interface. Select the **"Click here to import media"** option and upload your YouTube video. Alternatively, you can drag and drop your file.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 2 Drag the YouTube video, drop it in the **timeline,** and click the **"Play"** icon. Listen to the **voiceover** on your video footage and press the **"M"** key to add a marker. Next, click **"Titles"** from the toolbar and open the **"Subtitles"** tab from the left menu. **Double-click** the subtitle to download and preview it.

Step 3 Drag the downloaded subtitle template and drop it in the timeline. Now, adjust it in your video along with the marker point. Double-click the **subtitle template** in the timeline and type the text from the video voiceover.

You can also add color or template and adjust the text space to make them more visible on your video clip.

![adjust the text space](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/adding-subtitles-to-youtube-video-using-filmora.png)

Step 4 Click the "Advanced" option, delete the preset text, and set the one you've just typed. Next, head to the "Animation" tab to apply any animation effect and click "OK." Finally, repeat the steps to add subtitles to the whole video.
